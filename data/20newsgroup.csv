"A kind soul mailed reply bugs CView. Since isn't position post himself, asked post him, leave name out. So comes: CView quite number bugs. The one mention perhaps annoying, dangerous. As far I determine, temp files CView creates. CView gives user control places temp files: places ""current directory"". The problem mention occurs (as far I tell) runs disk space temp files. It seems CView doesn't check properly situation. As Cview decodes jpeg, seems write temp file pixel data 24 bit colour information. Then, 8 bit displays, ""dithering"", writing another file 8 bit colour information. While writing second file, also writes data colour card. Then last chunk 8 bit data, recopies data 8 bit file screen again. (It last ""recopy"" operation ""fit screen"" feature, even feature enabled.) The result process following: 1) If runs disk space writing first 24 bit file, ever see much data room for, last bit data simply repeated CView never realizes disk filled disk writes/reads aren't performed. 2) If enough room 24 bit data, runs room 8 bit data, see almost picture dithering writes screen card. However, finishes dithering recopies data 8 bit file screen (for whatever reason this) one gets repetition last chunk data room disk. This guess, probably fairly accurate. At least general idea track I think, although I probably made errors details file I/O etc. The way around course clear sufficient disk space. The temp files large JPEG's (1200x900 bigger) large (3 Meg + 1 Meg ). On largest I needed excess 6 Meg free disk space. CView much serious bug: trying display file floppy, change floppies CView temp file open floppy, CView certain circumstances write directory (and FAT table? I can't remember) removed floppy onto newly inserted floppy, thus corruptimg new floppy serious, possibly unrevcoverable way. SO BE CAREFUL! It incredibly poor programming program this. On hand, choosing files Open Files menu, CView insists disk reads every time one moves hi-lighter square. Incredibly annoying could gets directory info. And really, much effort take sort directory listing?",0

"Hello again, About week one-half ago I posted query looking people feelings inkjet family printers. Specifically, comparison Canon BJ200 (BubbleJet) Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 500. Many people asked post summary/account postings e-mail I received. Below original query responses I received. I deleted part responses, headers signatures, extract find necessary. Some people asked unbiased account; however, nature question suggests favoritism biased comments, must extract information believe unbiased fair representation printer. There wide range comments, value. There clear winner, like BJ200 (especially price/performance ratio), others preferred durability reliability DeskJet (the original inkjet proven drivers solid background). Two new inkjet printers drawn attention, new printer introduced Hewlett-Packard later year (around summertime), addition Epson product line (their first inkjet). You find initial purchase, costs re-filling replacing ink cartridges (this largely depends purchase re-fills replacements -- shop around first since aspect likely dominate cost printer). No one mentioned approx. many sheets ink cartridge print, I suspect roughly equal 1000 - 1500 sheets (laser printers 4000-5000 sheets per toner cartridge). Well, that's brief research summary personal research.

Just using regular copier paper produced fantastic results high quality mode. I compared output Micrografx Designer legal size drawing 4pt type done BJ 200 drawing printed HP Laserjet IID I amazed well I could read small print BJ 200.

Performance isn't spectacular Windows using TrueType fonts neither Canon I seen. Quality HP much dependent paper quality - 'standard' photo-copy paper characters slightly 'frayed' edges better quality 'distinction' type paper things look better. For applications I find copy paper fine - still better dot-matrix. Comes Windows driver, seems by-pass print manager, 'intelli-fonts'which HP scaleable fonts - probably faster TrueType haven't really tried out. Can get RAM FONT cartridges unless speed TrueType problem I wouldn't bother. The RAM cartridges can't used buffer - soft fonts only. For graphics, i.e. BMP images etc HP put dither mode via HP supplied Win driver. There number dither options 'scatter', 'pattern' etc. The manual gives recommendations depending type image printed. Text good mode. Problem arises document contains graphic text. The range tones graphic images isn't brilliant I think limitation inkjet printers general. However, printer definitely worth looking new inkjet Epson. This printer faster, cheaper, capable producing laser-like quality normal copier paper. Can't remember model #, LX - something I think? I purchased HP days Epson released :-{. The introductory price Epson HP New Zealand. =========================================================================== About month ago, I got Canon BJ200. I absolutely LOVE it. It incredibly fast, except printing PSPICE (I don't know ever stuff not.) Most stuff I print either Microsoft Word Windows plain text. The problems I've printing headers/footers (the printer freaked out), printing cheap paper (lots streaks). Normal copy paper works great it, tell it's laser-printed holding it, oh, less twelve inches face. (That is, you're nearsighted, like me! :) The printer comes driver Windows 3.1!! I complaints.

In fact one HP Deskjet Windows drivers gives significant control contrast density printer hence controlling amount ink put down. The Bubblejet not. I imaging software test printers comparision there.

The BJ-200 choice BJ-10ex - could 100 pages BJ-200 feeder. The BJ-10ex holds 30 pages, I think. As see, 100 pages BJ-200. We haven't done anything big BJ, performance seems reasonable Windows.

I can't remember much process except I read three reviews inkjets 500 always near top. I bought 500C added dimension colour (I intend build multi- media machine stage bought colour scanner towards that). Although I haven's used colour thing earnest yet I tried couple Windows bitmaps I pleased result. I note even though get 550C (the one colour mono need change cartridge), 500C 500 still readily available (at least UK). The following views/experience: 1. I don't know anything Canon except I came away reviews (and replies posting similar yours) idea HP offered best performance/price ratio. 2. I believe HP originals field - always ideal place market's still young one assumes expertise. 3. The 500C worth extra. Operation mono perfectly acceptable I get good crisp reproduction fonts Windows. 4. I used work Monotype still manufactured typesetters (before AMERICAN owners closed down!) I tell terms definition 300 dpi pretty poor anyway 360 dpi bit less poor... 5. The HP comes reasonable set drivers. 6. If buy invest additional RAM pack - it's pretty slow it, God knows it's like without! I actually work Germany PC home UK it's daily use. I would say apart reading manual properly really dumb problem start it's easy peasy operate. Hope use. Regards David =========================================================================== Just bought BJ-200. I thought price couldn't beat ($329, $50 rebate thru 5/31) far comparable, even superior, DeskJet print quality. Speed: Per page rate seems faster (I don't figures). I don't print long docs, though. Quality: I think graphics quality excellent. Print quality excellent well, unless use small fonts hold close; see lot ""jaggies"" LaserJet. The 360 dpi offset little less accuracy holding page/print head place, I would imagine. Large docs: Not room standard model whole lotta pages ... manual says 100, though. Haven't tried it.

Before I put good/bad points list, consider I Turbo Pascal/DOS programmer, sometimes try make something Unix C (just exercises university). I used make programs Microsoft C version 5 (!!) used third-party libraries required that. - I like Borland. It seems much easier use Microsoft, specially debugger. I tried learn Codeview sometimes, never felt confortable it. - TC++ V/E seems nice create simple apps, like examples ObjectWindows book. So far, problems. Lets see next week so, I try something complex. - It works nice even ""weak"" machine 386/16Mhz, 6 Mb Ram. But..... - The manual Resource Workshop seems different version Workshop itself. Some windows appear manual itens manual. - I think I run trouble since I got TC++/VE brother present. I didnt wanted buy Japanese version 1) I suspect manuals Japanese :-( 2) I believe far expensive here. So bought present sent me, I send registration card Japanese branch Borland, but... knows. So, I'd like ask questions all; - I know Microsoft guys around group.

Classification: K-means isodata. Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering reverse. Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median, generic. Complex Histogram/Contrast control. Layer Controller: manages 64 images time -- user extract single bands 3 band image create color images combining various individual bands, etc. The package designed remote sensing application (it handle VERY LARGE images) kinds software available GIS applications. Host Configuration Requirements It runs Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar Sun) though rumors (there always rumors) software would ported PC possibly Sun environment. PCI --- A company called PCI, Inc., Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes array software utilities processing, manipulation, use remote sensing data eight ten different ""industry standard"" formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, couple others whose titles I forget. The software available versions MS-DOS, Unix workstations (among HP, Sun, IBM), VMS, quite possibly platforms now. I use VMS version. The ""PCI software"" consists several classes/groups/packages utilities, grouped function operating common ""PCI database"" disk file. The ""Tape I/O"" package set utility programs read various remote-sensing industry tape formats INTO, write formats FROM, ""PCI database"" file; package I use know much about. Other packages display data PCI database one another several PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric bitmap representation image data attached printer, e.g. Epson-type dot-matrix graphics printer. You might spe- cifically interested mathematical operations package: histo- gram Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g. ""multiply channel 1 3, add channel 2, store channel 5""), God knows else -- there's LOT. I don't don't use these, can't say much them; buy packages particular application/interest calls for. Each utility controlled one eight ""parameters,"" read common ""parameter file"" must (in VMS anyway) ""default directory."" Some utilities share parameters use parameter different purpose, get bit confusing setting series operations. The standard PCI environment contains scripting language similar IBM-PC BASIC, allows automate process setting parameters common, complicated, lengthy difficult series utility executions. (In VMS I also invoke utilities independently DCL command procedure.) There's also optional programming library allows write compiled language programs interface (read from/write to) PCI data structures (database file, parameter file). The PCI software designed specifically remote-sensing images, requires level operator expertise that, reach level handle r-s images, figure ways handle things well. For instance, Tape I/O package offers utility reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop Macintosh calls ""raw"") data tape, number different ""interleave"" orders. This turns ideal manipulating graphic-arts industry's ""CT2T"" format, would probably (I haven't tried) handle Targa, on. Above all, however, HAVE TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING screw Nth degree start over. It's worth noting PCI ""database"" file designed contain ""raster"" (image) data, vectors (for overlaying map information entered via digitizing table), land-use, manner information (I observe remote-sensing image tape often contains manner information spectral bands, latitude, longitude, time, date, etc. original satellite pass; go PCI ""database""). I _believe_ workstations built-in display used. On VAX systems OTHER workstations PCI supports couple specific third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems come mind). One MY personal workarounds display program would display directly PCI ""database"" file Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus 24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem. PCI software COULD ""overkill"" case; seems designed ""high end"" applications/users, i.e. Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice (although know gap getting smaller time). It's probably coincidence PCI located Canada, country LOT land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe Canadian government uses PCI software work areas. SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager) -------------------------------- Back 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager) got fair amount use time. That designed Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels across <= 512 lines <= 256 bands); modified version since developed AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer) uses much larger images. Spam none things (rectification, classification, PC IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays). Actually, limited filtering contrast enhancement (stretching). Spam aimed spectral identification clustering. The original Spam uses X SunView display. The AVIRIS version may require VICAR, executive based TAE, may also require frame buffer. I refer people you're interested. PCW requires X display. MAP II ------ Among Mac GIS systems, MAP II distributed John Wiley.

"(I trouble posting article within tin week. If get multiple copies, apologies.) Here challenge Microsoft Microsort Supporters defend pathetic state DOS 6 upgrade distribution -- long story would make good reading interested knowing potential pitfalls ""upgrading"" DOS 6 I able notice week playing around it. My envorinment ============== TI TravelMate 4000 WinSX (486SX/25) 4M Ram 120M Disk System BIOS version 1.03 05/21/92 Texas Instruments CL-GD6420 VGA BIOS v 1.03 a1 Cirrus Logic Quadtel Advance Power Manager BATTERY.PRO v b6.00 Texas Instruments Smart Drive Cache (WIN3.1/DOS6) Parameters: 2048 1024 a- b- Windows Benchmark WinBench(tm) v 3.11 02/11/93 ZD Labs After ""updgrading"" DOS 6, I could understand certain things became slow, especially I decided try 'dblspace'. In process finding why, I discovered interesting things. Disk Performance Double Space Smart Drive ================================================== While things appear slow time, certain applications appeared run much slower. What interesting commands like 'chkdsk' 'defrag' running far slowly consider useful standards. I suspected Double Space (DS) decided measure impact system using WinBench(tm). The Real Disk WINMARK 20350 original system (as shipped factory DOS 5 Windowws 3.1) became 10718 ""upgraded"" DOS 6 DS. Thus effective performance degradation 50 percent really surprise I knew DS compression must cost something. Specifically, short sequential reads 512 bytes, DS actually *improves* transfer rates 10% (because CPU faster I/O, CPU cycles needed DS compensated savings I/O cycles). However, cases, particularly large random writes, transfers take three times long. While performance depends type access (i.e random sequential, small large transfer units), average (based WinBench's assumptions), disk slows half speed. The tests alone, done 'real mode' (see WinBench) smartdrv on, say much except helps put subjective statements like 'there noticable difference performance' even 'it speed disk access fast CPU slow disk I/O'. This explained applications ran markedly slower, 'chkdsk' 'defrag' (the latter especially) long. Double Space Windows ======================== DBLSPACE run within windows, even wanted get information, modify anything, matter even check usage -- try ""fasthelp dblspace"" dos box within windows see I mean error message get. How narrow minded programer get, I wonder. Yes, information obtained mstools.dd add-on file manager, 'mstools' dll understand compressed floppy! (Use DOS 6 supplement utility create compressed floppy dont know to.) DOS 6 Defragmenter incompatible TI APM ============================================== Defragmentation seemed take much time. Even so, I waited patiently till finished ran confirm. This confirmation 'dblspace /def' command 120M drive take 30 seconds (much faster defragmenters I used) took 12 minutes. I discovered I moved mouse, defragmentation checking ran faster (the % figure ticked rapidly). It dawned TI's battery saver Advanced Power Management (APM) module slows clock thinks CPU idle, obviously thought DS defragmentation idle process! After disabling TI's power saver, operation took 20 seconds. Microsft programmers think TI4000 Gateway NOMAD users idiots ==================================================================== In readme.txt file, find following Running Microsoft Backup TI4000 Gateway NOMAD computers ---------------------------------------------------------------- To avoid conflict Turbo feature Microsoft Backup Windows MS-DOS, add /L0 switch DEVICE command CONFIG.SYS loads BATTERY.PRO file. Or, run Microsoft Backup, type SETPOWER /L0 command prompt. If checked TI's manual /L0 option, realise means ""disable power saving features notebook"". Why would anyone want run driver disabled! As I found out, TI's power management interfere Microsoft Backup readme.txt claims, 'chkdsk' 'dblspace' (and knows else) crippled TI's power saver. It obvious thing APM specifications. If indeed thing, either Microsoft programmers TI programmers dont know read specifications. You dont guess idiots. By way, run advance power management utility, POWER.EXE Power Management Status ----------------------- Setting = ADV: MAX CPU: idle 60% time. This figure 60% seems steady state value notebook I running nothing (windows program manager iconised form). Does mean Windows takes 40% CPU itself, I best 60% left useful work? Is overhead justified (whether Windows operating system another user interface)? (In DOS alone, reports 99% idle time.) Looks like Windows good example busy waiting type package I like students study classical 'negative' example times! Microsoft programmers know batch programming =================================================== I like structure startup script thus equivalent addpath statements like this: set PATH=C:\DOS ... set PATH=C:\ETC\BIN;%PATH%;C:\BIN ... set PATH=C:\ETC\WINDOWS;%PATH%;C:\WINDOWS ... set PATH=%PATH%;C:\BCC\BIN ... set PATH=%PATH%;%MOUSE% Even though new dos installed directory old one (i.e. c:\dos), DOS 6 installation program modifes every path statement, prepends C:\DOS value. As result, resultant path many DOS's. If installation program wanted remove old DOS path, add new DOS path, clearly scan path statement containg old DOS directory replace new DOS path. (Even done new DOS installed directory different old one 'upgraded'.) Instead, Microsoft programmer (if call person one) decided meddle every path statement I autoexec prepend DOS value. I wonder Microsoft desparate would fire programmers incapable thought process. I started thread DOS 4 came up, Microsoft representative Singapore called poster. In fact specifically said US counterparts saw poster relayed information access internet. Now changed one bit. In fact, PATH statement %PATH% already it, obvious statement touched reason? As another example inability Microsoft programmers understand batch programming -- I mouse driver invoked as: set MOUSE=C:\ETC\MOUSE set PATH=%PATH%;%MOUSE% loadhigh %MOUSE%\MOUSE.COM Guess MEMMAKER did? It replaced last statement LH ... C:\ETC\MOUSE\MOUSE.COM Why difficult replace loadhigh LH parameters, without touching rest line, I understand. DOS 6 Software Quality ====================== DOS 6 operating system I know, which, normal usage, end creating file cannot get rid using commands come it. I deliberately cryptic this: I challenge Microsoft use programmers catch bug publish it. If dont within week, I post create ""ghost"" file. Surely I pick bug without even looking using particular command twice, I sure two dozen Microsoft (idiot) programmers randomly banging keyboards week could find -- I told Microsoft ""tests quality"" products. I think funny Microsoft found ways ""test quality"" accepted industry quality cannot tested, built product. No wonder cannot provide form guarantees products, even decent list bugs prevent scores user destroying disks beyond repair! Also, run 'dblspace /def' often enough, repeatedly disk fully defragmented, may get errors, created defragmenters. I got IO.SYS file size error got truncated I chkdsk. This happend five successive defragmentation efforst first one supposedly job new file creation since. Microsft, dont dare reply poster network admit DS bugs, willing let us know watch already used DS. Jaya",1

"[munch] [munch following reformatted] I'd say massive crash problems exceedingly rare. Windows _itself_ almost never crashes, crashed errant application (My personal favorite? Any one Corel 3.0 programs). On hand, I OS/2 crash randomly number times, mostly running it's applications. For instance. Today I discovered new one. While I downloading Procomm Plus For Windows (running seamless standard VGA drivers run-o' da mill VGA card--640x480), I decided I wanted edit copy quote I wanted add .finger. But since I've learned really trust seamless, I fired full screen WinOS/23.1 session. Whoops, download finished WinOS/2 loading. It _just_ gotten pointer up, I hit alt-escape get back desktop (I lot fonts, loading takes good long while). Blam. Screen trashed, Procomm hangs up. Hm. Well, I sorta see mouse, I clicked minimized WINOS/2 session got back fullscreen Windows session (but color off--red green yellow brown instead blues greys). So I closed this, got back desktop (now fully restored). PP+ still sitting, window open, longer ""connected"" com port--so I exited (the normal way-- told I still online would hang up, though _already_ hung up). Hm. Well, load anothe--no, bad idea. Shutdown reboot. Ok, refresh first.. Now, shutdown. Yes, everything closed... Hm. Nothing seems happening. Let's see.. Ah, windows list still comes up. OK, let's try shutdown again. No go. Huh. Alright, wait 60 seconds see it's running slow. Hmm. Still seems running OS/2. Try shutdown again. Nothing. Oh well. Reboot. Enjoy checkdisk time. In case, part OS crashed itself, OS/2 entirely (which isn't even smart enough tell it;s compromised, I guess). In everyday (specifically _today_) use. That's idea, anyway. In truth, program crashes OS/2, bring system it. The programs would GPF Windows OS/2, programs fine DOS Windows bring OS/2 screaming halt, task protection no. For instance, I'm still wondering print preview windowed WP 5.1 (DOS) locks system. It works fine DOS even dos box Windows 3.1. (Admittedly, doesn't crash I run WP51 full screen, first time bug big me, bit hard). Please explain. The time I wait anything Windows I'm copying formatting floppy, printing (and even then, long--I get 9 11 pages dumped printman per minute, _still_ go things--slowly--while it's this--I've downloaded PP+ @9600 printing). Not sure mean here. OS/2 sees 16 megs, uses 5 six it's use (more want count WinOS/2). Windows sees 16 megs, uses 3 4 (more like 5 count disk cache I OS/2) itself. If memory efficiency big issue, PC GEOS would current king Intel desktop. On hand.. I finally able say confidence OS/2 Windows bit hardware sensitivity them. For instance, machine I sitting runs fine, machine next constantly locks Windows. (But ran OS/2 without hitch I got 5-crash install). On whole, I'd say OS/2 whole lot sensitive Windows, (I suppose) machines Windows doesn't like. Wasn't _Ferris_ Bueller?",1

"I'm working system uses given set 3D key frame positions (x,y,z) control imaginary camera movement. I'm using Kochanek-Bartels splines (as described SIGGRAPH '84 proceedings) create variable number inbetweens key frames. I want inbetweens given form (x,y,z,dx,dy,dz) last three argumentsa x, z component viewing direction vector camera positioned (x,y,z). The method presented Kochanek Bartels deals positions inbetween view points generated. I've tried set viewing direction view point equal chord two adjacent view points (which general key frames), causes sligt discontinuity viewing direction vector key frame positions (although spatial movement seems work fine; I'm quite certain - I think :) - I've simply made implementation error...) Now I wonder anyone used spline form similar purposes decided viewing vectors.

Even cost needing instructions, task done quickly simpler, faster design.

"Has anyone observed this? If I copy large, say 800K+ file (a large PKZIP file instance) floppy drive (3.5"") MS Windows 3.1 via either Program Manager DOS Shell, file copied DOS shell errors whereas file copied within Program Manager not. The corruption detected executing ""pkunzip -t b:\file.zip"" copies. The file copied via DOS shell always shows corruption. Now here's kicker: I many windows open this; DOS WINDOWs apps. Supposedly WINDOWs' apps share time slice, whereas DOS apps get equal time slice (unless overriden). So, example, I 5 WINDOWs' apps open, 2 multitasking DOS sessions running, one execution-execlusive DOS shell iconized (inactive). Under scenario, CPU time divided two major slices: one Windows apps one slice running DOS app. When copying Windows PGM MGR, I'll assume Windows DOS tasks essentially inactive. Thus PGM MGR gets, say, 80% Windows slice 95% execution-background DOS shell's slices. Thus gets (.8)(.95)^2 = .72 72% total available CPU time. When copying DOS shell, I activate execute-exclusive mode DOS shell (no DOS background tasks allowed), full screen, Windows task manager. The CPU time available shell would 80% Windows slice (assumming inactive Windows applications) 100% DOS slice: (1.0)(.8) = .8 80% total available CPU time. So I get copy errors DOS greater amount CPU time? Is program manager working pre-emptive mode floppy copy? It must be!

"I suppose don't know discussed. We discussed error(s) XV 2.21 shows images 8bit, suggestion works perfectly it. So far I seen colormap editing window XV -- is, must colormap anyway. The problems present exist anyway, I didn't tried solve all, I would make problems programs first place. Gamma color corrections easily done 24bit image I presented. There's need make tricks 8bit/quantized image back 24 bit image. Ok, you're writing situation user want edit images 24bit user want edit individual colors -- questions, way, jumps discussion bit. My solution doesn't work, there's colormap withing real 24bit image -- see, user see 24bit image; going back 8bit silly. About changing individual colors 8bit/quantized/rasterized image: changing individual colors colormap useless cases image quantized rasterized -- small change may make serious errors anywhere image. XV allows feature, I don't recommend use mentioned type images. Moreover, XV paint program; make global changes. In full 24bit XV, changing individual colors sounds like paint program job. If person 8bit screen, there's need tricks get original 24bit image modified. Because user don't see full 24bit image, there's need make approximations possible modify individual colors individual pixels pixel groups (if image rasterized). To select indiavidual color, could 7x7 cursor window shows true color image cursor window area -- selecting individual color possible that. Ok, I don't thought much 24bit painting programs, never seen good view planned make such. Not mention 24bit painting program 8bit screen... It saved 8bit/quantized/rasterized images 24bit jpegs; jpeg designed that. Also, human expect 24bit saved 24bit image; say, person would like crop part image save it, expected image still same. So, XV designed without thinking human interface human expect program work -- design error. I heard XV designed first 8bit images/files, good idea take full 24bit images without making major change original design. So, even screen images 8bit, processed images saved images could 24bit easily, instead 8bit.

"To interested new ATI Ultra Cards: I posted questions regarding new ATI Ultra Pro cards asked confirmation opinions. This message summary responses. Thanks replied. a) The higher memory limits apply ISA cards only, far I know. The VLB EISA version problems. b) I'm pretty sure experience ISA version doesn't work systems 16M Ram. There supposed way switching ""memory aperture"" feature prevent this, apparently doesn't work. I posted ""help me"" messages net people indicated EISA card didn't problem. c) FALSE d) The VLB card, I have, allows set memory aperture 32M using configuration software. No messing jumpers necessary. The 32M problem probably valid ISA cards. a) Again, memory aperture need disabled 124M RAM (EISA VLB) 12 M (ISA). 32M problem you. b) Dunno. c) Depends bus. YES ISA, NO EISA Localbus a) Nope. I use 640x480 72hz, 24-bit 800x600 70hz, 24-bit, non-interlaced. b) Yes - According PC Magazine, they've tested local bus version 1024x768 24-bit may may interlaced. c) Not Pro. Sometimes Plus. Some modes may run interlaced certain monitors. This nothing 24 bits ... screen size. Note 24 bit color Windows MUST 2 megs, memory size calculations notwithstanding. a) They aren't perfect, much improved. I don't recall last time I leave mach 32 mode (ATI GUP mode) switch 8514 VGA mode due software incompatibility. b) True. Many people recommended going back Build 55 54. c) They appear excellent, bugs. For example, certain graphs dashed lines Mathcad 3.1 print correctly, though display OK screen. They par fancy cards .. accelerated cards also bugs. d) Overall, I like card, even driver performance somewhat less satisfactory. I running 1024*768 16 Color mode NT driver October NT version seems allow. I say Color performance quite nice Diamond Stealth VRAM, I able try lot options old driver. a) It's quite fast, whether fastest open debate. b) Yes - I'll admit fast 16-bit mode, I wanted use for. Too bad crashed (in many different ways) every 20 minutes so... c) Depends many many things. a) I like it. b) Well - PC Magazine seems think is. c) Yes, appears true :-) d) As greatest thing since sliced bread, I doubt it. Better cards coming out. Who knows, maybe ATI come something faster yet. Several reviews I read rated one Pycon Winjet card superior performer cheaper price except availability drivers, Pycon developing time. (PC Magazine, two months back) Overall, card lot potential, able use it. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- That end questions.

For example, letter ""O"" two outlines: 1) The outside outline clockwise (TrueType font) 2) The inside outline counterclockwise. One common solution used number rendering packages simply connect inner outline outer outline point two outlines closest. This equivalent descibing ""polygon holes"".

"[Please, note Newsgroups.] Recent discussion XV's problems held newsgroup. Here text users XV might find interesting. I added text collection article, read on, even articles ago. I hope author XV corrects problems best can, fine program XV worth improving. (I also minor ideas 24bit XV, e-mail them.) Any misundertanding mine understandable. Juhana Kouhia ==clip== [ ..deleted..] Note 'xv' saves 8bit/rasterized images; means saved jpegs like jpeg-to-gif-to-jpeg quality. Also, there's three kind 8bit quantizers; final image quality depends too. This situation I read jpeg FAQ ago. IMHO, design error 'xv'; confusing errors programs. There's two errors: -xv allows saving 8bit/rasterized image jpeg even original 24bit -- saving 8bit/rasterized image instead original 24bit special case -xv allows saving 8bit/rasterized image made quantizer -- main case 'xv' quantizes image best quantizer available saving image file; lousier quantizers viewing purposes (and special cases saving image, all) ==clip== ==clip== [ ..deleted..] It limit *XV*, limit design. It error design. It error 8bit/quantized/rasterized images stored jpegs; jpeg designed that. As matter fact, I'm sure XV designed 24bit displays known. It bad error program program 8bit images time, 24bit image formats included program whole design changed support 24bit images. That done -the program violate jpeg design (and 24bit image format) -the program human interface errors. Otherway drop saving images jpegs 24bit format without clearly saying special case expected normal use. [ ..deleted.. ] ==clip== Some new items follows. ==clip== I seen XV quantizes image sometimes poorly -best24 option default option have. The reason surely quantizer used -best24; (surprise) used ppmquant. If remember, I tested quantizers. In test I found rlequant (with default) best, comes djpeg, fbmquant, xv (our default) order. In test ppmquant suggeeded poorly -- actually gave image bad artifacts. I don't know ppmquant improved any, I expect no. So, use XV's -best24 option good idea. I suggest author XV changes quantizer one used rlequant -- I'm sure rle-people gives permission. (Another could one used ImageMagick; I tested it, I say nothing it.) ==clip== ==clip== Some minor bugs human interface are: Key pressings cursor clicks goes buffer; Often happens I make click errors press keyboard cursor wrong place. It annoying waited image come five minutes gone away immediately. The buffer cleaned image complete. Also, good idea wait seconds activating keyboard mouse XV image completed. Often happens image pops screen quickly, I'm writing something editor such. Those key pressings go XV image gone something weird. In color editor, I turn color meter release it, XV updates images. It impossible change RGB values first get updated image. It annoying wait image updated setting ready yet. I suggest adding 'apply' button update exchanges done.",0

"Speaking SIGGRAPH, I went ordeal annual registration SIGGRAPH re-upping membership ACM last night, I ever grossed out! The new prices membership almost highway robbery! For example: SIGGRAPH basic fee went $26 last year $59 year thing, 127% increase. Those facile enough arrange trip annual conference could reduce $27 selecting SIGGRAPH Lite, means SIGGRAPH charging additional $32 (or so) proceedings art show catalog, essentially. TOPLAS went 40% cost, way outstripping current inflation rate. Basic SIGCHI fees remainded same, whereas SIGCHI membership included UIST Human Factors conferences proceedings, extra cost option. Bundling back basic rate, equivalent services gone 100% cost. SIGOIS membership cost 33%, they've also split Computer Supported Cooperative Work conference proceedings used included membership. Adding cost back means SIG also doubled membership fee. What really galls ACM sent brochures couple months ago touting new approach providing member services, tried make sound like offering NEW services. But exception couple, like SIGGRAPH, ""plus"" services appear splitting costs smaller piles don't look big. But recommended changes membership would paying 90% last year 31% increase services (measured cost, value), and, curiously, 31% inflation rate publications I got last year.

"------------------------------------- + ............The OTIS Project '93 + + ""The Operative Term Is STIMULATE"" + ------------------------------------- ---this file last updated..4-21-93--- WHAT IS OTIS? OTIS purpose distributing original artwork photographs network public perusal, scrutiny, distribution. Digital immortality. The basic idea behind ""digital immortality"" computer networks stay anything interesting deposit around near-forever. The GIFs JPGs today artifacts digital future. Perhaps they'll put different formats, perhaps surviving backup tapes....but they'll there...and someone dig up. If doesn't interest you... OTIS also offers forum critique exhibition works....a virtual art gallery never closes exists information dimension submissions hang wallpaper thousands glowing monitors. Suddenly, life breathed work...and merit it's stimulus, travel globe pulses light electrons. Spectators welcome also, feel free browse gallery let artists know think efforts. Keep copies images look you've got gumption... that's they're for. --------------------------------------------------------------- WHERE? OTIS currently (as 4/21/93) two FTP sites. 141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), UWI site sunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS), SUNsite (you also GOPHER site OTIS well) Merely ""anonymous FTP"" either site Internet change appropriate directory. Don't forget get busy use ""bin"" command make sure you're binary. OTIS also spreading dial-up BBS systems around North America....the following systems substancial supply OTIStuff... Underground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines CyberDen (SanFran?) (415.472.5527) Usenet Waffle-iron -------------------------------------------------------------- HOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE? What happens is...you draw pretty picture take lovely photo, get scanned image file, either FTP-put CONTRIB/Incoming directory use UUENCODE send (email addresses eof) email. After image received, put correct directory. Computer originated works also welcome. OTIS' directories house two types image files, GIF JPG. GIF JPG files require, oddly enough, GIF JPG viewer see. These viewers available types computers large FTP sites around Internet. JPG viewers bit tougher find. If can't find one, GIF viewer, obtain JPG-to-GIF conversion program change JPG files standard GIF format. OTIS also accepts animation files. When submit image files, please send email time stating information uploaded whether used (in publications projects) merely people view. Also, include biographical information yourself, we'll info-files contributing artist works. You also upload text-file info (instead emailing). If pictures, scanner, hope. Merely send copies to: The OTIS Project c/o Ed Stastny PO BX 241113 Omaha, NE 68124-1113 I either scan get someone scan them. Include ample SASE want stuff back. Also include information image, preferably 1-3 line description image include infofile directory it's finally put. If preferences images named, include well. Conversely, scanner would like help out, please contact we'll arrange things. If want submit works disk, peachy. Merely send 3.5"" disk address (Omaha) SASE want disk back. This good people don't direct access encoders FTP, access scanner. We accept disks either Mac IBM compatible format. If possible, please submit image files GIF JPG. If can't...we convert formats...we'd rather to. At senders request, also fill disks much OTIS stand. Even don't stuff contribute, send blank disk SASE (or $2.50 disk, postage packing) get slab-o-OTIS. As 04/21/93, we're 18 megabytes files, growing. Email current archive size directory. -------------------------------------------------------------------- DISTRIBUTION? The images distributed OTIS project may distributed freely condition original filename kept altered way (save convert one image format another). In fact, encourage files distributed local bulletin boards such. If could, please transport appropriate text files along images. It would also nice you'd send note post images OTIS local bbs. I want keep track participants idea widespread stuff is. It's purpose OTIS get images spread much possible. If time, please upload favorite BBS system....or even post ""info-file"" there. It would keen you. -------------------------------------------------------------------- USE? If want use works find OTIS directory, you'll check see permission granted stipulations permission (such free copy publication, full address credit). You either find "".rm"" file image series images...or ""Artists"" directory Artists name. If permission isn't explicitly given, you'll contact artist ask it. If info available, email (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), I'll get contact artist you, give contact information. When DO use permitted work, it's always courteous let artist know it, perhaps even send free copy compensation files. --------------------------------------------------------------------- NAMING IMAGES? Please keep names files ""dos"" format. That means, keep filename (before .jpg .gif) eight characters less. The way I usually use initials artist, plus three four digit ""code"" series images, plus series number. Thus, Leonardo DeVinci's fifth mechanical drawing would something like: ldmek5.gif OR ldmek5.jpg OR ldmech5.gif ETC Keeping names 8 characters assures filename remain intact systems. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- CREATING IMAGE FILES? When creating image files, sure least include name somewhere picture. This gives people reference case they'd like contact you. You may also want include title, address information you'd like people know. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- HMMM?! That's now.

The files go public large. It's possible, form mass-media, someone could unscrupulously use images financial gain. Unless you've given permission that, it's illegal. OTIS takes responsibility this. In simple terms, rights revert author/artist. To leave image OTIS give permission viewed, copied distributed electronically. If don't want images distributed all-over, don't upload them.

For instructions use archive, send e-mail address words ""help"" ""index"" (no quotes) separate lines. If don't get reply, server may misreading return address; add line ""path myname@mysite"" specify correct e-mail address reply to. ---------- [1] What JPEG? JPEG (pronounced ""jay-peg"") standardized image compression mechanism. JPEG stands Joint Photographic Experts Group, original name committee wrote standard. JPEG designed compressing either full-color gray-scale digital images ""natural"", real-world scenes. It work well non-realistic images, cartoons line drawings. JPEG handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, handle motion picture compression. Standards compressing types images worked committees, named JBIG MPEG respectively. JPEG ""lossy"", meaning image get decompression isn't quite identical originally put in. The algorithm achieves much compression exploiting known limitations human eye, notably fact small color details aren't perceived well small details light-and-dark. Thus, JPEG intended compressing images looked humans. If plan machine-analyze images, small errors introduced JPEG may problem you, even invisible eye. A useful property JPEG degree lossiness varied adjusting compression parameters. This means image maker trade file size output image quality. You make *extremely* small files don't mind poor quality; useful indexing image archives, making thumbnail views icons, etc. etc. Conversely, aren't happy output quality default compression setting, jack quality satisfied, accept lesser compression. [2] Why use JPEG? There two good reasons: make image files smaller, store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead 8-bit-per-pixel data. Making image files smaller big win transmitting files across networks archiving libraries images. Being able compress 2 Mbyte full-color file 100 Kbytes makes big difference disk space transmission time! (If comparing GIF JPEG, size ratio like four one. More details below.) If viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll convert JPEG format viewing manipulating images. Even JPEG-capable viewer, takes longer decode view JPEG image view image simpler format (GIF, instance). Thus, using JPEG essentially time/space tradeoff: give time order store transmit image cheaply. It's worth noting network phone transmission involved, time savings transferring shorter file much greater extra time decompress file. I'll let arithmetic yourself. The reason JPEG gradually replace GIF standard Usenet posting format JPEG store full color information: 24 bits/pixel (16 million colors) instead 8 less (256 fewer colors). If 8-bit display hardware may seem like much advantage you. Within couple years, though, 8-bit GIF look obsolete black-and-white MacPaint format today. Furthermore, reasons detailed section 7, JPEG far useful GIF exchanging images among people widely varying color display hardware. Hence JPEG considerably appropriate GIF use Usenet posting standard. [3] When I use JPEG, I stick GIF? JPEG *not* going displace GIF entirely; types images, GIF superior image quality, file size, both. One first things learn JPEG kinds images apply to. As rule thumb, JPEG superior GIF storing full-color gray-scale images ""realistic"" scenes; means scanned photographs similar material. JPEG superior even don't 24-bit display hardware, LOT superior do. (See section 7 details.) GIF significantly better images distinct colors, cartoons line drawings. In particular, large areas pixels *exactly* color compressed efficiently indeed GIF. JPEG can't squeeze files much GIF without introducing visible defects. This sort image best kept GIF form. (In particular, single-color borders quite cheap GIF files, avoided JPEG files.) JPEG also hard time sharp edges: row pure-black pixels adjacent row pure-white pixels, example. Sharp edges tend come blurred unless use high quality setting. Again, sort thing found scanned photographs, shows fairly often GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc. The blurriness particularly objectionable text that's pixels high. If GIF lot small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it. Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, instance) usually fall scanned images cartoons terms complexity. The complex subtly rendered image, likely JPEG well it. The goes semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings such). Plain black-and-white (two level) images never converted JPEG. You need least 16 gray levels JPEG useful gray-scale images. It also noted GIF lossless gray-scale images 256 levels, JPEG not. If existing library GIF images, may wonder whether convert JPEG. You lose little image quality do. (Section 7, argues JPEG image quality superior GIF, applies formats start full-color original. If start GIF, you've already irretrievably lost great deal information; JPEG make things worse.) However, disk space savings may justify converting anyway. This decision you'll make yourself. If convert GIF library JPEG, see section 14 hints. Be prepared leave images GIF format, since GIFs convert well. [4] How well JPEG compress images? Pretty darn well. Here sample file sizes image I handy, 727x525 full-color image ship harbor. The first three files comparison purposes; rest created free JPEG software described section 6B. File Size bytes Comments ship.ppm 1145040 Original file PPM format (no compression; 24 bits 3 bytes per pixel, plus bytes overhead) ship.ppm.Z 963829 PPM file passed Unix compress compress doesn't accomplish lot, you'll note. Other text-oriented compressors give similar results. ship.gif 240438 Converted GIF ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif Most savings result losing color info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, 24. (See sec. 7.) ship.jpg95 155622 cjpeg -Q 95 (highest useful quality setting) This indistinguishable 24-bit original, least nonprofessional eyeballs. ship.jpg75 58009 cjpeg -Q 75 (default setting) You look mighty darn close distinguish original, even on-screen once. ship.jpg50 38406 cjpeg -Q 50 This slight defects; know look for, could tell it's JPEGed without seeing original. Still good image quality many recent postings Usenet pictures groups. ship.jpg25 25192 cjpeg -Q 25 JPEG's characteristic ""blockiness"" becomes apparent setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some). Still, I've seen plenty Usenet postings poorer image quality this. ship.jpg5o 6587 cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize (-optimize cuts table overhead) Blocky, perfectly satisfactory preview indexing purposes. Note file TINY: compression ratio original 173:1 In case JPEG make file that's factor four five smaller GIF comparable quality (the -Q 75 file every bit good GIF, better full-color display). This seems typical ratio real-world scenes. [5] What good ""quality"" settings JPEG? Most JPEG compressors let pick file size vs. image quality tradeoff selecting quality setting. There seems widespread confusion meaning settings. ""Quality 95"" NOT mean ""keep 95% information"", claimed. The quality scale purely arbitrary; it's percentage anything. The name game using JPEG pick lowest quality setting (smallest file size) decompresses image indistinguishable original. This setting vary one image another one observer another, rules thumb. The default quality setting (-Q 75) often best choice. This setting lowest go without expecting see defects typical image. Try -Q 75 first; see defects, go up. Except experimental purposes, never go -Q 95; saying -Q 100 produce file two three times large -Q 95, hardly better quality. If image less perfect quality begin with, might able go -Q 50 without objectionable degradation. On hand, might need go HIGHER quality setting avoid degradation. The second case seems apply much time converting GIFs JPEG. The default -Q 75 right compressing 24-bit images, -Q 85 95 usually better converting GIFs (see section 14 info). If want small file (say preview indexing purposes) prepared tolerate large defects, -Q setting range 5 10 right. -Q 2 may amusing ""op art"". (Note: quality settings discussed article apply free JPEG software described section 6B, many programs based it. Other JPEG implementations, Image Alchemy, may use completely different quality scale. Some programs don't even provide numeric scale, ""high""/""medium""/""low""-style choices.) [6] Where I get JPEG software? Most programs described section available FTP. If don't know use FTP, see FAQ article ""How find sources"". (If don't direct access FTP, read ftpmail servers article.) That article appears regularly news.answers, get sending e-mail mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu ""send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources"" body. The ""Anonymous FTP List FAQ"" may also helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq news.answers archive. NOTE: list changes constantly. If copy couple months old, get latest JPEG FAQ news.answers archive. [6A] If looking ""canned"" software, viewers, etc: The first part list system-specific programs run one kind system. If don't see want machine, check portable JPEG software described end list. Note list concentrates free shareware programs obtain Internet; commercial programs listed too. X Windows: XV (shareware, $25) excellent viewer JPEG, GIF, many image formats. It also format conversion simple image manipulations. It's available FTP export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12), file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z. Version 3.00 major upgrade support 24-bit displays many improvements; however, brand new still bugs lurking. If prefer bleeding edge, stick version 2.21, also available export. Note version 2.21 good choice 24-bit display (you'll get 8-bit color), converting 24-bit images JPEG. But 2.21 works fine converting GIF 8-bit images JPEG. CAUTION: glitch version 2.21: sure check ""save normal size"" checkbox saving JPEG file, file blurry. Another good choice X Windows John Cristy's free ImageMagick package, also available export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z. This package handles many image processing conversion tasks. The ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; colormapped displays, better (though slower) color quantization XV basic free JPEG software. Both large, complex packages. If want simple image viewer, try xloadimage xli. xloadimage supports JPEG latest release, 3.03. xloadimage free available export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z. xli variant version xloadimage, said fans somewhat faster robust original. (The current xli indeed faster robust current xloadimage, least respect JPEG files, IJG v4 decoder xloadimage 3.03 using hacked-over v1. The next xloadimage release fix this.) xli also free available export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z. Both programs said right thing 24-bit displays. MS-DOS: This covers plain DOS; Windows OS/2 programs, see next headings. One good choice Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, views JPEG GIF files. The current version, 2.5, available FTP sunee.uwaterloo.ca (129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip. This good basic viewer works either 286 386/486 machines. The user interface flashy, it's functional. Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview. The current version, 1.2, available Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip. Hiview requires 386 better CPU VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 386MAX work; Windows OS/2 not). Hiview currently fastest viewer images bigger screen. For larger images, scales image fit screen (rather using panning/scrolling viewers do). You may may prefer approach, there's denying slows loading large images considerably. Note: installation bit tricky; read directions carefully! A shareware alternative ColorView DOS ($30). This easier install either two freeware alternatives. Its user interface also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find harder use --- keystrokes, inconsistent behavior. It faster DVPEG little slower Hiview, least hardware. (For images larger screen size, DVPEG ColorView seem speed, faster Hiview.) The current version 2.1, available Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip. Requires VESA graphics driver; don't one, look vesadrv2.zip vesa-tsr.zip directory. (Many recent PCs built-in VESA driver, don't try load VESA driver unless ColorView complains driver missing.) A second shareware alternative Fullview, kicking around net while, I don't know stable archive location it. The current (rather old) version inferior viewers anyway. The author tells new version Fullview shortly submitted Simtel20 archives time. The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG latest revision, 8.60a. However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't good: it's slow (about half speed viewers) image quality poor except hi-color displays. Too bad ... it'd nice see good JPEG capability CSHOW. Shareware, $25. Available Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip. Due remarkable variety PC graphics hardware, one viewers might work particular machine. If can't get *any* work, you'll need use one following conversion programs convert JPEG GIF, view favorite GIF viewer. (If hi-color hardware, don't use GIF intermediate format; try find TARGA-capable viewer instead. VPIC5.0 reputed right thing hi-color displays.) The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters FTPable Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or jpeg4386.zip 386 extended memory). These files DOS compilations free source code described section 6B; convert JPEG GIF, Targa, PPM formats. Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF. These slow limited conversion GIF format; particular, can't get 24-bit color output JPEG. The major advantage tools read write HSI's proprietary JPEG format well Usenet-standard JFIF format. Since HSI-format files rather widespread BBSes, useful capability. Version 2.0 tools free (prior versions shareware). Get Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip. NOTE: use HSI format files posted Internet, since readable non-PC platforms. Handmade Software also shareware image conversion manipulation package, Image Alchemy. This translate JPEG files (both JFIF HSI formats) many image formats. It also display images. A demo version Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 available Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip. NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site PC-related programs Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20). Simtel20 runs non-Unix system weird directory names; document refers directory (eg) ""msdos/graphics"" Simtel20, really means ""pd1:<msdos.graphics>"". If physically MILnet, expect rather slow FTP transfer rates Simtel20. There several Internet sites maintain copies (mirrors) Simtel20 archives; FTP users go one mirror sites instead. A popular USA mirror site oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), keeps Simtel20 files (eg) ""/pub/msdos/graphics"". If FTP capability, retrieve files Simtel20 e-mail; see informational postings comp.archives.msdos.announce find how. If outside USA, consult newsgroup learn nearest Simtel20 mirror is. Microsoft Windows: There several Windows programs capable displaying JPEG images. (Windows viewers generally slower DOS viewers hardware, due Windows' system overhead. Note run DOS conversion programs described inside Windows DOS window.) The newest entry WinECJ, free EXTREMELY fast. Version 1.0 available ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip. Requires Windows 3.1 256-or-more-colors mode. This no-frills viewer bad habit hogging machine completely decodes; image quality noticeably worse viewers. But it's fast you'll use anyway, least previewing... JView freeware, fairly fast, good on-line help, write decompressed image Windows BMP format; can't create new JPEG files, doesn't view GIFs. JView also lacks useful features shareware viewers (such brightness adjustment), it's excellent basic viewer. The current version, 0.9, available ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip. (Mirrors archive found Internet sites, including wuarchive.wustl.edu.) WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, BMP image files; write formats too, used converter. It nifty features including color-balance adjustment slideshow. The current version 2.1, available Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip. (This slow 286-compatible version; register, you'll get 386-only version, roughly 25% faster.) ColorView another shareware entry ($30). This early promising contender, updated time, point real advantages WinJPEG. If want try anyway, current version 0.97, available ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip. (I understand new version appearing authors finished ColorView DOS.) DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works Windows, full-screen mode, window. OS/2: The following files available hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151). Note: check /pub/uploads recent versions --- hobbes moderator fast moving uploads permanent directories. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip 32-bit version free IJG conversion programs, version 4. /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip 16-bit version same, OS/2 1.x. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing PM graphical interface.

Shareware, $20. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer. GIF viewing fast, JPEG viewing fast huge amounts RAM, otherwise speed programs. Strong 24-bit display support. Shareware, $20. Macintosh: Most Mac JPEG programs rely Apple's JPEG implementation, part QuickTime system extension; need QuickTime installed. To use QuickTime, need 68020 better CPU need running System 6.0.7 later. (If you're running System 6, must also install 32-bit QuickDraw extension; built-in System 7.) You get QuickTime FTP ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx. (As 11/92, file contains QuickTime 1.5, better QT 1.0 several ways. With respect JPEG, marginally faster considerably less prone crash fed corrupt JPEG file. However, applications seem compatibility problems QT 1.5.) Mac users keep mind QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format. (See section 10 details.) If post images Usenet, make sure JFIF format. Most programs mentioned generate either format. The first choice probably JPEGView, free program viewing images JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, GIF format. It also convert two JPEG formats. The current version, 2.0, big improvement prior versions. Get sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx. Requires System 7 QuickTime. On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces best color image quality currently available Mac JPEG viewers. JPEGView view large images much less memory Mac viewers; fact, it's one deal JPEG images much 640x480 pixels typical 4MB Mac. Given large image, JPEGView automatically scales fit screen, rather presenting scroll bars like viewers. (You zoom desired portion, though.) Some people like behavior, don't. Overall, JPEGView's user interface well thought out. GIFConverter, shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF PICT/JPEG, well GIF several image formats. The latest version 2.3.2. Get sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx. Requires System 6.0.5 later. GIFConverter better JPEGView plain JPEG/GIF viewer, much extensive image manipulation format conversion capabilities, may find worth shareware fee lot playing around images. Also, newest version GIFConverter load save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, best bet machine old run QuickTime. (But it's faster QuickTime.) Note: If GIFConverter runs memory trying load large JPEG, try converting file GIF JPEG Convert, viewing GIF version. JPEG Convert, Mac version free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, available sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx. This run Mac, file conversion, viewing. You use conjunction GIF viewer. Previous versions FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, JPEG<=>GIF converter based old version IJG code. If using program, definitely replace JPEG Convert. Apple's free program PictPixie view images JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, GIF format, convert formats. You get PictPixie ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx. Requires QuickTime. PictPixie intended developer's tool, it's really best choice unless like fool around QuickTime. Some drawbacks requires lots memory, produces relatively poor color image quality anything less 24-bit display, relatively unfriendly user interface. Worse, PictPixie unsupported program, meaning minor bugs Apple intend fix. (There old version PictPixie, called PICTCompressor, floating around net. If trash it, it's even buggier. Also, QuickTime Starter Kit includes much cleaned-up descendant PictPixie called Picture Compressor. Note Picture Compressor NOT free may distributed net.) Storm Technology's Picture Decompress free JPEG viewer/converter. This rather old program inferior programs many ways, run without System 7 QuickTime, may forced use older systems. (It need 32-bit QuickDraw, really old machines can't use it.) You get sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx. You must set file type downloaded image file 'JPEG' allow Picture Decompress open it. If machine old run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus instance), GIFConverter choice single-program JPEG viewing. If don't want pay GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert free GIF viewer. More commercial Mac applications supporting JPEG, although deal Usenet-standard JFIF format. Adobe Photoshop, version 2.0.1 later, read write JFIF-format JPEG files (use JPEG plug-in Acquire menu). You must set file type downloaded JPEG file 'JPEG' allow Photoshop recognize it. Amiga: (Most programs listed section stored AmiNet archive amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80). There many mirror sites archive try use closest one. In USA, good choice wuarchive.wustl.edu; look /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...) HamLab Plus excellent JPEG viewer/converter, well general image manipulation tool. It's cheap (shareware, $20) read several formats besides JPEG. The current version 2.0.8. A demo version available amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha. The demo version crop images larger 512x512, otherwise fully functional. Rend24 (shareware, $30) image renderer display JPEG, ILBM, GIF images. The program used create animations, even capturing frames on-the-fly rendering packages like Lightwave. The current version 1.05, available amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha. (Note: although directory supposedly AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, program also run AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 2.1.) Viewtek free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer. The current version 1.04, available amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha. If you're willing spend real money, several commercial packages support JPEG. Two written Thomas Krehbiel, author Rend24 Viewtek. These CineMorph, standalone image morphing package, ImageFX, impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting, effects prepress package also includes CineMorph. Both distributed Great Valley Products. Art Department Professional (ADPro), ASDG Inc, widely used commercial image manipulation software Amigas. ImageMaster, Black Belt Systems, another well-regarded commercial graphics package JPEG support. The free IJG JPEG software available compiled Amigas amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) directory amiga/gfx/conv, file AmigaJPEGV4.lha. These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats. The Amiga world heavily infested quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many based ancient beta-test version free IJG JPEG software (thanks certain magazine published disk-of-the-month, without much notifying authors). Among ""AugJPEG"", ""NewAmyJPEG"", ""VJPEG"", probably others I even heard of. In opinion, anything older IJG version 3 (March 1992) worth disk space it's stored on; program, trash get something newer. Atari ST: The free IJG JPEG software available compiled Atari ST, TT, etc, atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo. These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats. For monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, manages achieve four-level grayscale effect flickering. Version 4.1 reads JPEG files. Available atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo. I heard free shareware JPEG-capable viewers Ataris, surely must now? Pointers appreciated. Acorn Archimedes: !ChangeFSI, supplied RISC OS 3 version 3.10, convert view JPEG JFIF format. Provision also made convert images JPEG, although must done CLI rather double-clicking. Recent versions (since 7.11) shareware program Translator handle JPEG, along 30 image formats. While older versions found Archimedes bboards, current version available registering author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede, The Netherlands. Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 10 pounds). There's also commercial product called !JPEG provides JPEG read/write functionality direct JPEG viewing, well host image format conversion processing options. This expensive necessarily better programs. Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST, Cambridge, UK. Tel: 0223 841099. Portable software almost system: If none fits situation, obtain compile free JPEG conversion software described 6B. You'll also need viewer program. If display 8 bits less, GIF viewer fine; display color capability, try find viewer read Targa PPM 24-bit image files. There numerous commercial JPEG offerings, popping every day. I recommend spend money one unless find available free shareware software vastly slow. In case, purchase hardware-assisted product. Ask pointed questions whether product complies final JPEG standard whether handle JFIF file format; many earliest commercial releases never compatible anyone else's files. [6B] If looking source code work with: Free, portable C code JPEG compression available Independent JPEG Group, I lead. A package containing source code, documentation, small test files available several places. The ""official"" archive site source code ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9 192.48.96.9). Look directory /graphics/jpeg; current release jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z. (This compressed TAR file; don't forget retrieve binary mode.) You retrieve file FTP UUCP. If PC don't know cope .tar.Z format, may prefer ZIP format, find Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip. This file also available CompuServe, GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, jpsrc4.zip. If FTP access, retrieve source nearest comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared issues 55-72 volume 34. (If don't know retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see FAQ article ""How find sources"", referred top section 6.) The free JPEG code provides conversion JPEG ""JFIF"" format image files GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, Truevision Targa file formats. The core compression decompression modules easily reused programs, image viewers. The package highly portable; tested many machines ranging PCs Crays. We released software noncommercial commercial use. Companies welcome use basis JPEG-related products. We ask royalty, although ask acknowledgement product literature (see README file distribution details). We hope make software industrial-quality --- although, anything that's free, offer warranty accept liability. The Independent JPEG Group volunteer organization; you'd like contribute improving software, welcome join. [7] What's hoopla color quantization? Most people don't full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware. Typical display hardware stores 8 fewer bits per pixel, display 256 fewer distinct colors time. To display full-color image, computer must map image appropriate set representative colors. This process called ""color quantization"". (This something misnomer, ""color selection"" would better term. We're stuck standard usage though.) Clearly, color quantization lossy process. It turns images, details color quantization algorithm MUCH impact final image quality errors introduced JPEG (except lowest JPEG quality settings). Since JPEG full-color format, converting color JPEG image display 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization. This true *all* color JPEGs: even feed 256-or-less-color GIF JPEG, comes decompressor *not* 256 colors, thousands colors. This happens JPEG's lossiness affects pixel little differently, two pixels started identical colors probably come slightly different colors. Each original color gets ""smeared"" group nearby colors. Therefore quantization always required display color JPEG colormapped display, regardless image source. The way avoid quantization ask gray-scale output. (Incidentally, effect it's nearly meaningless talk number colors used JPEG image. Even attempted count number distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give different results roundoff error differences. I occasionally see posted images described ""256-color JPEG"". This tells poster (a) hasn't read FAQ (b) probably converted JPEG GIF. JPEGs classified color gray-scale (just like photographs), number colors isn't useful concept JPEG.) On hand, GIF image definition already quantized 256 fewer colors. (A GIF *does* definite number colors palette, format doesn't allow 256 palette entries.) For purposes Usenet picture distribution, GIF advantage sender precomputes color quantization, recipients don't to. This also *disadvantage* GIF: you're stuck sender's quantization. If sender quantized different number colors display, re-quantize, resulting much poorer image quality quantized full-color image. Furthermore, sender didn't use high-quality color quantization algorithm, you're luck. For reason, JPEG offers promise significantly better image quality users whose machines don't match sender's display hardware. JPEG's full color image quantized precisely match user's display hardware. Furthermore, able take advantage future improvements quantization algorithms (there lot active research area), purchase better display hardware, get better view JPEG images already have. With GIF, you're stuck forevermore sent. It's also worth mentioning many GIF-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines. If view 256-color GIF 16-color EGA display, example, probably getting much worse image need to. This partly inevitable consequence two color quantizations (one create GIF, one display it), often it's also due sloppiness. JPEG conversion programs forced use high quality quantizers order get acceptable results all, normal use quantize directly number colors displayed. Thus, JPEG likely provide better results average GIF program low-color-resolution displays well high-resolution ones! Finally, ever-growing number people better-than-8-bit display hardware already: 15-bit ""hi-color"" PC displays, true 24-bit displays workstations Macintoshes, etc. For people, GIF already obsolete, cannot represent image full capabilities display. JPEG images drive displays much effectively. Thus, JPEG all-around better choice GIF representing images machine-independent fashion. [8] How JPEG work? The buzz-words know chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine transforms, coefficient quantization, Huffman arithmetic entropy coding. This article's long enough already, I'm going say here. For technical information, see comp.compression FAQ. This available news.answers archive rtfm.mit.edu, files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3]. If need help using news.answers archive, see top article. [9] What lossless JPEG? There's great deal confusion subject. The JPEG committee define truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one guarantees final output bit-for-bit identical original input. However, lossless mode almost nothing common regular, lossy JPEG algorithm, offers much less compression. At present, implementations lossless JPEG exist, commercial. Saying ""-Q 100"" free JPEG software DOES NOT get lossless image. What get rid deliberate information loss coefficient quantization step. There still good deal information loss color subsampling step. (With V4 free JPEG code, also say ""-sample 1x1"" turn subsampling. Keep mind many commercial JPEG implementations cannot cope resulting file.) Even quantization subsampling turned off, regular JPEG algorithm lossless, subject roundoff errors various calculations. The maximum error counts one pixel value; it's highly unlikely could perceived human eye, might concern machine processing image. At minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files perhaps half size uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image. True lossless JPEG provides roughly amount compression, guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy. If application requiring lossless storage images less 6 bits per pixel (per color component), may want look JBIG bilevel image compression standard. This performs better JPEG lossless images. JPEG lossless superior JBIG images 6 bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG public domain (at least Huffman back end), JBIG techniques heavily covered patents. [10] Why argument file formats? Strictly speaking, JPEG refers family compression algorithms; *not* refer specific image file format. The JPEG committee prevented defining file format turf wars within international standards organizations. Since can't actually exchange images anyone else unless agree common file format, leaves us problem. In absence official standards, number JPEG program writers gone ""do thing"", result programs aren't compatible anybody else's. The closest thing de-facto standard JPEG format work that's coordinated people C-Cube Microsystems. They defined two JPEG-based file formats: * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), ""low-end"" format transports pixels much else. * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, extension Aldus TIFF format. TIFF ""high-end"" format let record everything ever wanted know image, lot besides :-). TIFF lot complex JFIF, may well prove less transportable, different vendors historically implemented slightly different incompatible subsets TIFF. It's likely adding JPEG mix anything improve situation. Both formats developed input major vendors JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely future commercial products adhere one standards. I believe Usenet adopt JFIF replacement GIF picture postings. JFIF simpler TIFF available now; TIFF 6.0 spec recently officially adopted, still unusably vague crucial details. Even TIFF/JPEG well defined, JFIF format likely widely supported ""lowest common denominator""; TIFF/JPEG files may never transportable. A particular case people may interested Apple's QuickTime software Macintosh. QuickTime uses JFIF-compatible format wrapped inside Mac-specific PICT structure. Conversion JFIF QuickTime JPEG pretty straightforward, several Mac programs available (see Mac portion section 6A). If editor handles binary files, strip QuickTime JPEG PICT JFIF hand; see section 11 details. Another particular case Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF Image Alchemy). These programs capable reading writing JFIF format. By default, though, write proprietary format developed HSI. This format NOT readable non-HSI programs used Usenet postings. Use -j switch get JFIF output. (This applies old versions programs; current releases emit JFIF format default. You still careful post HSI-format files, unless want get flamed people non-PC platforms.) [11] How I recognize file format I have, I it? If alleged JPEG file software won't read, it's likely HSI format proprietary JPEG-based format. You tell inspecting first bytes file: 1. A JFIF-standard file start characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0, followed two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed 'JFIF'. 2. If see FF D8 start, rest it, may ""raw JPEG"" file. This probably decodable as-is JFIF software --- it's worth try, anyway. 3. HSI files start 'hsi1'. You're luck unless HSI software. Portions file may look like plain JPEG data, won't decompress properly non-HSI programs. 4. A Macintosh PICT file, JPEG-compressed, couple hundred bytes header followed JFIF header (scan 'JFIF'). Strip everything FF D8 able read it. 5. Anything else: it's proprietary format, JPEG all. If lucky, file may consist header raw JPEG data stream. If identify start JPEG data stream (look FF D8), try stripping everything that. In uuencoded Usenet postings, characteristic JFIF pattern ""begin"" line M_]C_X ... whereas uuencoded HSI files start ""begin"" line M:'-I ... If learn check former, save trouble downloading non-JFIF files. [12] What arithmetic coding? The JPEG spec defines two different ""back end"" modules final output compressed data: either Huffman coding arithmetic coding allowed. The choice impact image quality, arithmetic coding usually produces smaller compressed file. On typical images, arithmetic coding produces file 5 10 percent smaller Huffman coding. (All file-size numbers previously cited Huffman coding.) Unfortunately, particular variant arithmetic coding specified JPEG standard subject patents owned IBM, AT&T, Mitsubishi. Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless obtain licenses companies. (The ""fair use"" doctrine allows people implement test algorithm, actually storing images dubious best.) At least short run, I recommend people worry arithmetic coding; space savings isn't great enough justify potential legal hassles. In particular, arithmetic coding *should not* used images exchanged Usenet. There small chance legal situation may change future. Stay tuned details. [13] Does loss accumulate repeated compression/decompression? It would nice if, compressed image JPEG, could decompress it, manipulate (crop border, say), recompress without image degradation beyond lost initially. Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE. In general, recompressing altered image loses information, though usually much lost first time around. The next best thing would decompress image recompress *without changing it* loss, i.e., get identical JPEG file. Even true; least, current free JPEG software. It's essentially problem accumulation roundoff error. If repeatedly compress decompress, image eventually degrade see visible changes first-generation output. (It usually takes many cycles get visible change.) One things to-do list see accumulation error avoided limited, I optimistic it. In case, could possibly guaranteed would compressing unmodified full-color output djpeg, original quality setting, would introduce loss. Even simple changes cropping border could cause roundoff-error degradation. (If you're wondering why, it's pixel-block boundaries move. If cropped multiples 16 pixels, might safe, that's mighty limited capability!) The bottom line JPEG useful format archival storage transmission images, don't want use intermediate format sequences image manipulation steps. Use lossless format (PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) working image, JPEG ready file away. Aside avoiding degradation, save lot compression/decompression time way :-). [14] What rules thumb converting GIF images JPEG? As stated earlier, *will* lose amount image information convert existing GIF image JPEG. If obtain original full-color data GIF made from, it's far better make JPEG that. But need save space GIF work from, suggestions getting maximum space savings minimum loss quality. The first rule converting GIF library look JPEG, make sure happy it, throwing away corresponding GIF; give chance re-do conversion higher quality setting necessary. Some GIFs may better left GIFs, explained section 3; particular, cartoon-type GIFs sixteen fewer colors don't convert well. You may find JPEG file reasonable quality *larger* GIF. (So check sizes too.) Experience date suggests large, high-visual-quality GIFs best candidates conversion JPEG. They chew storage offer potential savings, convert JPEG least degradation. Don't waste time converting GIF much 100 Kbytes. Also, don't expect JPEG files converted GIFs small created directly full-color originals. To maintain image quality may let converted files much twice big straight-through JPEG files would (i.e., shoot 1/2 1/3rd size GIF file, 1/4th suggested earlier comparisons). Many people developed odd habit putting large constant-color border around GIF image. While useless, nearly free terms storage cost GIF files. It NOT free JPEG files, sharp border boundary create visible artifacts (""ghost"" edges). Do favor crop border JPEGing. (If X Windows system, XV's manual automatic cropping functions painless way this.) cjpeg's default Q setting 75 appropriate full-color input, GIF inputs, Q settings 85 95 often seem necessary avoid image degradation. (If apply smoothing suggested below, higher Q setting may necessary.) Color GIFs photographs complex artwork usually ""dithered"" fool eye seeing 256 colors GIF actually store. If enlarge image, see adjacent pixels often significantly different colors; normal size eye averages pixels together produce illusion intermediate color value. The trouble dithering that, JPEG, looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise; JPEG can't compress noise well. The resulting JPEG file larger lower image quality would gotten JPEGing original full color image (if it). To get around this, want ""smooth"" GIF image compression. Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating color thought saw anyway, process getting rid rapid color changes give JPEG trouble. Appropriate use smoothing often let avoid using high Q factor, thus reducing size compressed file, still obtaining better-looking output image you'd get without smoothing. With V4 free JPEG software (or products based it), simple smoothing capability built in. Try ""-smooth 10"" converting GIFs. Values 10 25 seem work well high-quality GIFs. Heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors. (If see regular fine-scale patterns GIF image even without enlargement, strong smoothing definitely called for.) Too large smoothing factor blur output image, don't want. If image processing wizard, also smoothing separate filtering program, pnmconvol PBMPLUS package. However, cjpeg's built-in smoother LOT faster pnmconvol... The upshot ""cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10"" probably good starting point converting GIFs. But really care image, you'll want check results maybe try settings. --------------------- For information JPEG general free JPEG software particular, contact Independent JPEG Group jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.",0

"I'm asking help sticky problem involving unreasonably low apparent precision Z-buffering, I've encountered 2 different PEX implementations. I can't find discussion problem resources I lay hands (e.g. comp.windows.x.pex FAQ, Gaskins's _PEXlib_Programming_Manual_, vendors' documentation). I'm posting article comp.graphics, virtually article test program demonstrating problem comp.windows.x.pex. The problem hard describe without pictures, hence article longish. If run PEXlib 5.x programs interested, I encourage build run test program comp.windows.x.pex see effect play approach dealing it. (It depends utility code Gaskins book; instructions fetching via anonymous FTP given.) The problem solved eliminate minimize ""stitching"" artifacts resulting use Z-buffering polylines coplanar filled areas. The interpolated Z values along line differ slightly, due roundoff error, interpolated Z values across area, even endpoints line coincident vertices area. Because this, it's tossup whether Z-buffer allow line pixels area pixels displayed. Visually, result tends dashed-line effect even though line supposed solid. Using PEXlib API, approach solution use two slightly different PEX view mapping transforms, two view table entries, one areas one lines. The PEX structures immediate- mode output must organized one view table index always effect areas, always effect lines. The result slight shift NPC Z coordinates lines, attempt bias tossup situations favor lines. This shift effected moving front back clipping planes used PEXlib view table entry lines hair ""backwards"" (i.e. smaller VRC Z coordinates), compared positions view table entry used areas. This means point transformed NPC, Z value slightly bigger comes line comes area, thus accomplishing desired bias. I would expect Z roundoff errors cause problem amount units most, entire dynamic range Z-buffer, typically 0 65535 16777215 (i.e. 16 24 bit Z-buffers). Therefore, seems tiny fraction range Z VRC front back clip planes ought suffice reliably fix stitching. But fact, experience shows shift much 0.003 0.006 range. (Empirically, it's worst NPC Z component slope surface high, i.e. appears less edge-on viewer.) It's 8 9 bits Z-buffer dependable meaning! This amount great one problem replaced another: sometimes polylines ""show through"" areas supposed lie behind.

The test program demonstrates problem MIT PEXlib 5.x implementation; version known compile run HP-UX system PEX 5.1. Open questions: (1) Why happen? -- Am I configuring PEX view table wrongly? -- Is systematic difference Z interpolation lines opposed areas (e.g. pixel centers versus corners) could corrected for? -- Are PEX implementors wantonly discarding Z precision interpolators? -- Something else? (2) What it? -- Can I fix use view table allow better precision Z-buffered HLHSR? -- Is another approach I take remove stitching artifacts? -- Am I luck? Any help would immensely appreciated!",0

"From article <C68uBG.K2w@world.std.com>, cfw@world.std.com (Christopher F Wroten): Good question. Answer: The EISA bus move 32 bits rather ISA's 8/(16?) But still moves speed ISA bus. I think that's either 8 10 mhz. The local bus designs also move 32 bits like EISA, move data cpu speed, 40 mhz. So, 33mhz cpu, local bus moving 32bit data 33 mhz, EISA moving 32bit data 8 10 mhz. So local bus 3 4 times faster EISA 33 mhz cpu. EISA two (maybe 3) times fast ISA. That's good question. The EISA bus advantages ISA bus it's width. For example: more/better interrupts bus mastering.

"Sorry I missed Raymond, I Dahlgren last month... I'm Virtual Reality market manager Silicon Graphics, perhaps I help little. Unfortunately, SGI systems used create special effects Terminator 2 Lawnmower Man, film-quality computer graphics, rendered software written film frame time. Each frame computer animation films took hours render high-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, level graphics would difficult, impossible, acheive real time (30 frames per second). It depends upon serious advanced application is. True immersive visualization (VR), requires rendering complex visual databases anywhere 20 60 newly rendered frames per second. This similar requirement traditional flight simulators pilot training. If frame rate low, user notices stepping frames move head rapidly around scene, motion graphics smooth contiguous. Thus graphics system must powerful enough sustain high frame rates rendering complex data representations. Additionally, frame rate must constant. If system renders 15 frames per second one point, 60 frames per second next (perhaps due scene new viewing direction simpler visible before), user get heavily distracted medium (the graphics computer) rather focusing data. To maintain constant frame rate, system must able run real-time. UNIX general support real-time operation, Silicon Graphics modified UNIX kernel multi-processor systems able support real-time operation, bypassing usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. Uniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time operation (not Sun SPARC10, HP 700 Series systems, IBM RS-6000, even SGI's uniprocessor systems like Indigo Crimson). Only multiprocessor Onyx Challenge systems support real-time operation due Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture. From graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments requires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping real-time multi-sample anti-aliasing.

In addition, last 10 years, I think de-emphasis producing running programs AI research, greater emphasis formal approaches problem-solving. Students proving theorems instead writing programs.

": I normal procomm plus dos, I've considering buying : windows version....it got really great reviews computer shopper. : I friend connects mainframe unix machines : using it, screen seems problem keeping : modem....he 14,400 modem 486 50 Mhz machine. I can't : see trouble keeping up. His pcplus dos works great, re: What high speed modem arrives. Edition 01 Apr 93 This article applies Windows 3.0 3.1, NT, OS/2 DOS apps running Windows. One unadvertised limitations current Windows PCs RS-232C (serial, COM) performance seriously deficient. Almost everyone purchases high-speed modem (V.32bis, V.32, PEP HST) discovers problem first time try download file accept incoming FAX (at 9600+) upgrading modem. Overrun retry errors abound, even active application datacomm FAX program. If transfer completes all, may take even longer old 2400bps modem. There three reasons problem: 1. The Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitters (UARTs) used PCs primitive Ns8250 devices single-byte FIFO buffers. If operating system/driver cannot read flush character high interrupt rates, next incoming character overwrites FIFO previous one lost. DOS, fairly single-minded environment datacomm, usually keep up. Windows can't. 2. Windows operating system overhead plain DOS, interrupts often take longer service. Overruns much likely DOS. As soon report PC/modem vendor losing data, may advised ""you need upgrade 16550"". More likely, since seems conspiracy ignorance issue, you'll get useful advice all. Most store-front mail-order sources I spoke attempting solve problem never heard term ""16550"" many didn't even know UART was. 3. Even PC Ns16550A UARTs (and PS/2's do), upgrade mother/COM board add new COM board, may STILL experience errors overruns standard MicroSoft Windows COM drivers don't take full advantage 16550. Windows 3.1 improved regard 3.0, I still recommend driver upgrade. Applications like ProComm+/Win (which I use) cannot get around problem themselves. If modem CARD, may problem, modem part card designed aware state UART, avoid overrunning it; however, I wouldn't want bet card designers clever, insist 16550 UART I ever buy modem card. Some modem cards don't even conventional UARTs, work standard Windows drivers, need simulate one. Use MSD.EXE (below) see modem card is, pretending be. The Hardware Situation. The UARTs PC COM ports based National Semiconductor Ns8250 Ns16450 chips (or megacells inside VLSI chips can't replace them). You ID UART type system running MicroSoft diagnostic program \WINDOWS\MSD.EXE. Be sure run DOS *before* bringing Windows. The Windows serial API may prevent MSD accurately identifying 16550 run Windows DOS prompt. The Ns16550 UART separate 16-byte transmit receive FIFOs configurable trigger levels, run reliably clock rates 460,800 bps, although current modem technology, there's point pushing luck going 115,200 bps. The 16550 shorted access cycle times 16450 8250. The 16550 also DMA capability, clear PC drivers ever use this. For technical info, see National Semiconductor Application Note AN-491. So, UART component have? Try locate UART mother board, multi-function I/O card, COM board ISA/MCA modem card. If can't find socketed component numbers ""8250"" ""16450"", COM ports probably buried VLSI, won't able perform chip replacement. If DISABLE VLSI COM ports (as I chose do), least add aftermarket COM board. If one socketed 8250 16450 chips, buy plug-in Ns16550AFN PC16C550CN (low power CMOS version) ICs several suppliers typically $9 $15 each. The ""N"" chip normal 40-pin dual-in-line package. Other styles available, avoid Ns16550 chips without ""A"" (the 16C550C presumably OK). Early Ns chips bugs, although National reportedly exchange manufacture free. Clone chips available various IC makers National. The manual TurboCom drivers states support following (apparently equivalent) chips: National Semiconductor: 16550A, 16551, 16552 Chips&Technology: 82C607 Texas Instruments: t16c550a Silicon Systems: 73M550 VLSI 16C550 TurboCom warns pre-""A"" Ns16550 Western Digital 16C550, says problems reported early IBM PS/2 55SX 70 systems (IBM reportedly upgrade them). If DON'T socketed 8250/16450 chips, you'll need buy after- market COM multi-function board. If modem card situation, may hosed. To add new COM multi-function card, you'll need either disable COM1/2 port(s) replacing, re-assign COM3/4 (although watch IRQ conflicts without TurboCom). Although cheaper cards available, interest getting problem solved quickly I elected buy Modular Circuit Technology MCT-AIO+ card from: JDR Microdevices 2233 Samaritan Drive San Jose CA 95124 (800) 538-5000 voice US (408) 559-1200 voice (800) 538-5005 FAX US The MCT-AIO+ (and ""+"" important) sells $89.95.

Meanwhile, back MCT card JDR... I needed two serial ports, running IRQs PC, I disabled built-in VLSI-based 8250 ports. However, TurboCom driver (below), I could set internals COM3 4, using IRQ sharing. The Software Situation Simply upgrading 16550 UARTs completely solve common overrun problems. The standard MS serial drivers don't take full advantage 16550. The Windows 3.0 drivers even less capable, Windows 3.1 drivers following limitations: - They enable receive FIFO, rates 2400 bps. - They never enable transmit FIFO, results interrupt rate 10x uploads. - They set trigger level 14 bytes (too high - it's easy 2 bytes arrive driver read FIFO). - The Ports menu Control Panel allows speeds 19200. With V.32bis modem, sparse data text easily compress 3:1 more, suggesting host DTE connect rate 57,600 bps would effective. - The API won't accept rates ""CBR_128000"". - The API won't let DOS programs know 16550 there, even did, DOS programs aren't 16550-aware get little benefit 16550 port standard drivers. - They don't allow IRQ sharing COM3,4. - The BIOS doesn't initialize COM3,4 properly many systems. - Windows provides workaround apps don't provide port speed options 19200 bps. These problems reportedly NOT solved Windows NT DOS 6.0, may may addressed Windows releases 3.1 (but 4.0). Rumors suggest ""may"" solved Windows ""4.0"". You get replacement drivers solve problems buying copy ""TurboCom"", current version 1.2, from: Bio-Engineering Research Pacific CommWare Division 180 Beacon Hill Lane Ashland OR 97520-9701 (503) 482-2744 voice (503) 482-2627 FAX (503) 482-2633 BBS MCImail: 344-5374 CompuServe: 71521,760 Price around $50 I recall. Bio-Eng set accept credit cards, I send check. Egghead 1-800-Software list TurboCom far I know, don't stock it. Bio software company per se. They apparently needed reliable hi-speed serial connections in-house instrument application, wrote driver, discovered market it, revised general purpose COM driver suite. They recently upgraded Windows 3.1. It run-time licensed. I host (DTE) connect rate set 57,600 bps datacomm apps, I ZERO problems downloads. I routinely see transfer rates exceed 2,000 bps. I also using 115,200 bps linking HP95LX PC, lossless bi-directional I/O. Uploads various remote systems another matter, many hosts still using antique UARTs drivers. Note 19200 still highest rate Windows 3.1 Port menu Control Panel allow configuring COM port. TurboCom gets around allowing specify, port, factor set real UART rate multiple rate passed Windows APIs dialog boxes. I also CTS/RTS hardware flow control enabled, I suggest same. Even ever transfer 7-bit ASCII data, Xon/XOff sufficiently reliable method flow control. The informal (DEC) standard Xon/Xoff hysteresis sender may transmit another 16 (yes, sixteen) bytes receipt Xoff receiving system device. The 16 byte FIFO 16550 clearly big enough let us rely exclusively Xon/Xoff. A well-respected datacomm engineer informed 16550's can't really CTS/RTS DOS/Windows environment, using data rates 115,200 may still risky. Even hardware flow control, 16550 TurboCom still experience overruns busy systems, lots apps running serious swapping progress. If situation, may need buy co-processed COM board, cost 16550/TurboCom upgrade. A review two boards, review TurboCom, found Feb'93 issue ""Windows Sources"" magazine. I suggest trying 16550/TurboCom upgrade first, experiment process priorities time slices ""power user"" whose thrashing system still runs comm problems. Closing Soapbox Comments The state RS-232C serial datacomm support embarrassment across computer industry. Because oldest standard I/O interface, job designing hardware writing software often seems assigned least senior lowest ranked engineers computer companies. The design average serial port least ten years behind state art. In last job, major workstation vendor, I lobbied improved serial ports initial designs new system. That family machines subsequently introduced 16550 ports. However, exception. Few computer companies seem champions decent I/O. You may well learn serial I/O, situation shows sign improving soon. When V.FAST arrives, I expect cries outrage Windows users world-wide whose 8250 PCs ""sort of"" work today V.32, fail miserably V.FAST. Without hardware-buffered UART (like 16550) without software drivers use UART best advantage, V.FAST modem waste money.

The definitions arranged order decreasing frequency usage: :hacker: [originally, someone makes furniture axe] n. 1. A person enjoys exploring details programmable systems stretch capabilities, opposed users, prefer learn minimum necessary. 2. One programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) enjoys programming rather theorizing programming. 3. A person capable appreciating {hack value}. 4. A person good programming quickly. 5. An expert particular program, one frequently work using it; 'a UNIX hacker'. (Definitions 1 5 correlated, people fit congregate.) 6. An expert enthusiast kind. One might astronomy hacker, example. 7. One enjoys intellectual challenge creatively overcoming circumventing limitations. 8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler tries discover sensitive information poking around. Hence 'password hacker', 'network hacker'. See {cracker}. The term 'hacker' also tends connote membership global community defined net (see {network, the} {Internet address}). It also implies person described seen subscribe version hacker ehic (see {hacker ethic, the}). It better described hacker others describe oneself way. Hackers consider something elite (a meritocracy based ability), though one new members gladly welcome. There thus certain ego satisfaction identifying hacker (but claim one not, you'll quickly labeled {bogus}). See also {wannabee}. :hacker ethic, the: n. 1. The belief information-sharing powerful positive good, ethical duty hackers share expertise writing free software facilitating access information computing resources wherever possible. 2. The belief system-cracking fun exploration ethically OK long cracker commits theft, vandalism, breach confidentiality. Both normative ethical principles widely, means universally) accepted among hackers. Most hackers subscribe hacker ethic sense 1, many act writing giving away free software. A go assert *all* information free *any* proprietary control bad; philosophy behind {GNU} project. Sense 2 controversial: people consider act cracking unethical, like breaking entering.

"We IBM problem workstations. I also shocked I first realized offset lines fills 16 bits (assuming 24 bit z buffer). This seems huge, 1/256 dynamic range. In terms doesn't seem bad. What happening interpolation z totally linear, due mainly roundoff, I believe. So polygon planar z, like Ruffles potato chip. Ditto lines. When start/end different x/y values, ""ridges"" phase, resulting stitch effect. You problem try draw 1 polygon right top another, different vertices. You likely see smeared effect overlap. Example: Try Polygon 1: (100,100,100) (100,200,100) (200,200,100) (200,100,100) Polygon 2: (125,125,100) (125,175,100) (175,175,100) (175,125,100) Your implementation correct. In fact, similar trick rendering primitives lines polygons - NURBS surfaces isoparametric lines. Without trick, lines appear stitched, say. When application draws lines/polygons independently, system smarts automatically z shifting, application must it. This discovered doing. Bravo!

[*] Since viewpoint always same, routines hard-coded particular vantage. In case, wall two's rising edge slope 1/4. (I'm also using Mode X, 320x240). I've run two problems; I'm sure readers tried before, perhaps formulated opinions: 1) The routines drawing walls 1 2 trivial, I ran packed->planar image them, I dismayed ""jaggies."" I'm considered anti-aliasing routines (speed really necessary). Is worth effort artist draw wall already skewed, thus assured nice image, much burden? 2) Wall 3 presents problem; algorithm I used tends overly distort original. I tried decide paper pixels go where, failed. Has anyone come method mapping planar crosswise sheared shape?

[*] For noticed, top lines wall 2 (and wall 1) *are* parallel bottom lines. This appears optical illusion (ie. appears either inside outside cube, depending mood). There vanishing points. This simplifies drawing code objects (which don't change size move room).

"More people asking information Kubota graphics workstations, info Kenai/Denali vs. E&S Freedom. Here text Denali vs. E&S Freedom done D.H. Brown Associates. ------ Denali bears strong resemblance Evans Sutherlands Freedom graphics subsystem several aspects high-level design. Both products use parallel array 29050 processors geometric computations. Both pixel router connect front end second array pixel processors. As result, Denali Freedome overlap significantly performance functionality. Both design teams also appear similar philosophies respect modularity, scalability, market penetration. There remain, however, several important differences KPC E&S products. Evans Sutherland designed Freedom high-end developer's dream system plenty performance potential flexibility. In favor, Freedom configurations two sixteen floating point units, border range starts ends higher price performance levels Denali. All Freedom systems include large, fixed number pixel processors support broader variety color blending functions. The Freedom design treats entire image memory general-purpose memory, allowing developers allocate flexible basis number special-purpose applications. Finally, E&S provided Freedom flexible otput video integration features multimedia simulation applications. Note KPC working auxiliary board NTSC PAL output require external video encoder. E&S programmable output features, however, remain much flexible. The KPC design team, contrast, made Denali end-user's system. Entry version better performance range flexibility low-end Freedom configurations, come realistic mainstream price points. Denali need many 29050 modules Freedome uses deeper scan-conversion pipeline support one, resulting better cost/performance characteristics. Although products provide strong support 3D, imaging, volume rendering, KPC recognized users want even mix capabilities. Denali's configuration flexibility allows customers effect purchase geometric pixel processing capabilities separately, upgrade separately needed. Both companies implemented hardware texture mapping workstation price levels way attack SGI's expensive VGXT RealityEngine systems -- products provide capability. KPC supports point sampling bilinear interpolation textures hardware, provides software support higher qualtiy tri-linear interpolated mipmapping method. On balance, however, Denali provideds bettern overall texturing capabilities E&S applications. Aside much affordable, KPC solutions deliver parallelism texture processing off-screen memory general graphics data storage. By implementing texture mapping transformation modules, E&S foces customers move quickly higher price levels obtain better texturing performance. Kubota avoids problem linking texturing Frame Buffer Modules, providing lower-cost, scalable solution. Hope helps, Brian",0

"Certainly. Reference follows. Bear mind least two conditions may called red/green colour blind. One, protanopia, caused lack major dysfunction L cones, respond best long wavelengths. This gives much reduced red/green red/violet discrimination also means reds look dimmer people normal vision. The other, deuteranopia, due missing dysfunctional M cones although also caused lack L-M cone difference signals retina. It also gives reduced red/green discrimination red/violet unaffected. Unlike protanopia, reds dimmer normal. On uniform chromaticity diagram - horseshoe shaped one see computer graphics books - single confusion point type colour deficiency. Colours confused lie straight lines radiating point. For protanopia point u'=0.61,v'=0.51, close far red corner. For deuteranopia, point u'=-4.75, v'=1.31 Note different experimental investigations literature give slightly different values depending precise details experimental setup, random errors, on. The values quoted typical. So colours line seen same, colour actually seen? This problem solved. Tests people one normal eye one affected eye shown axis type disorder onto colours collapse. For protanopes joins 473nm 574nm spectral locus (the edge horseshoe); deuteranopes line similar, joining 477nm 579nm. *So* convert colours normal vision simulated protanopia duuteranopia: 1) Plot colour uniform chromaticity diagram 2) Construct line point appropriate confusion point 3) Find intersection line appropriate axis line 4) This new chromaticity. The best reference Meyer, G.W. Greenberg, D.P. (1988) 'Colour defective vision computer graphics displays', IEEE Computer Graphics Applications 8(5) 28-40. You also need decent reference basic colour science familiar CIE XYZ colour model uniform chromaticity scale diagram. Yes certainly possible. You need chromaticities red green blue phosphors monitor intend display images on, chromaticity white point. This information measured, obtained manufacturer. I posted list monitor chromaticities couple weeks ago. The procedure, pixel (!) follows. (Some lookup tables might help here.) A) convert RGB CIE XYZ. This simple 3*3 matrix multiplication monitor data. B) retaining Y component later, convert XYZ chromaticity coordinates u'v' using u' = 4X/(X+15Y+3Z), v' = 9Y/(X+15Y+3Z) C) find equation line step 2 D) find intersection step 3 E) convert back u'v' XYZ, using Y value step A F) Ensure new colour displayed monitor; not, move along line XYZ space towards neutral grey (ie half way black white) displayable. Done; also posted rest us. -- Chris Lilley ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Technical Author, ITTI Computer Graphics Visualisation Training Project Computer Graphics Unit, Manchester Computing Centre, Oxford Road, Manchester, UK.

"Well, yeah, unlike TIFF substantially encode rectangular bitmaps. And others hardly trouble free. I hear quite common CGM implementations interoperate. The annoying thing TIFF along 50 useful options, 100 stupid options. The egregious example rather picking byte order bit order using consistently TIFF files, byte bit order options TIFF readers machines, matter natural byte order, prepared byte swapping. There four slightly different FAX formats -- again, one would adequate. RGB images stored pixel component, complexity without function, etc, etc. I also note TIFF doc says Aldus' experiments show LZW reliably compresses well better FAX formats, suggesting none FAX formats really useful. What's worse, lot formats aren't even implemented well, e.g., LZW limits code words 12 bits, 14 16 bits would provided substantially better compression. And LZW method compresses bytes rather pixels. But absolute worst thing TIFF vendor register proprietary TIFF codes formats without even publicly documenting them. This means NO WAY write TIFF reader reliably read incoming TIFF files.

Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial linear non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic logic operations, geometric transformations, among others. Morphological transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole removal, object separation, extraction skeletons, among others. Quantitative analysis provides objects' detection, measurement, morphological distribution. Measures include area, perimeter, center gravity, moment inertia, orientation, length relevant chords, shape factors equivalence. Measures saved ASCII format. The program also provides macro scripting integration custom modules. A 3-D view command plots perspective data graph image intensity depicted mountains valleys plot. The histogram tool plotted either linear logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight arithmetic logical operations provide for: masking averaging sections images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc. There 13 spatial filters alter pixel intensities based local intensity. These include high-pass filters contrast outlines. The frequency data resulting FFT analysis displayed either (real imaginary components (phase, magnitude) data. The morphological transformations useful data sharpening defining objects removing artifacts. The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating even hole filling.

Minnesota driver (based SLIP8250) Of four, I vastly prefer C/SLIPPER.EXE SLIP8250.COM ETHERSL.COM following reasons: a) It much faster even though modem 16450 UART b) While using EtherSLIP/SLIP8250/UMSLIP, several others noticed PC clock gets messed performing long FTP transfer. c) It supports PKTMUX used ethernet simulation mode d) When used Ethernet simulation mode C/SLIPPER seem work every TCP/IP application I tested with. Instructions C/SLIPPER.EXE (and use PHONE) a) Load SLIPPER AUTOEXEC.BAT file according instructions: For instance v.32bis modem COM1 slipper com1 vec=62 baud=57600 b) If use DOS TCP/IP applications Win 3.1 DOS boxes, use double-ended packet driver shim WinPKT.COM -- creates virtual packet driver 0x60. DOS applications native mode, DOS applications Windows 3.1 DOS boxes Windows applications use virtual driver 0x60. winpkt.com 0x60 0x62 c) If use QVT/Net, load PKTINT.COM next. QVT/net configured QVTNET.INI use interrupt 0x60. pktint.com Instructions SLIP8250.COM: a) Try getting version 10 SLIP driver. Philip Burns Northwestern University modified SLIP8250.COM driver better hardware handshaking. This driver distributed along NuPOP. b) Load driver AFTER establishing SLIP connection. My modem V.32bis modem COM1, I would load driver. slip8250 -w 0x62 -h 4 SLIP 0x03f8 57600 c) As discussed use DOS TCP/IP applications Windows 3.x DOS boxes, probably want use WINPKT.COM winpkt.com 0x60 0x62 d) If use WinQVT/net, load PKTINT.COM pktint.com Instructions ETHERSL.COM: If choose use ETHERSL.COM instead SLIP8250.COM, instructions exactly one crucial difference. You DELETE line ""device=*vcd"" [386Enh] section SYSTEM.INI. This interfere running regular Windows Comm applications (such Crosstalk), get lots dropped characters etc. applications. This therefore recommended. ETHERSLIP would loaded as: ethersl -w 0x62 -h 4 0x03f8 57600 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Configuring Windows 3.1: a) Make following modifications SYSTEM.INI file [386Enh] section. i) List COM ports, addresses interrupts. COM1Base=03F8 COM1Irq=4 COM2Base=02F8 COM2Irq=3 COM3Base=03E8 COM3Irq=5 This also done within Windows - Control Panel, double-clicking ""Ports"" icon. ii) Give port modem attached generous COM buffer COM1Buffer=10000 iii) Change COM port AutoAssign value COM port wish use modem ZERO. This amount time Windows waits seconds handing control COM port another application. If use WinQVT/net want switch one session another, value default value 2 seconds, get GPF Windows crash. COM1AutoAssign=0 This also done within Windows - Control Panel. Double-click 386 Enhanced, ""Device Contention"", set device contention COM port modem ""Never Warn"" ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Additional notes: ---------------------------------------------------------------------- What assigned different IP address SLIP session? I fortunate campus SLIP server assigns user permanent IP address, I worry editing QVTNET.INI time I establish SLIP connection. If assigned new IP address every occasion dial in, please try use BOOTP aware software, let BOOTP configuration you. However, QVTnet BOOTP aware RARP work SLIP connection. To get QVTNet working situation this, must following: Edit QVTNET.INI file. Let [net] section look like this: [net] name= ip= netmask=255.255.255.0 (or whatever appropriate you) arptime=20 packet_vector=60 (or whatever appropriate) Save changes, *write-protect* file ""attrib +r qvtnet.ini"" Start slip connection, *remember* name IP address assigned. Each time start QVT/net 3.1x, general configuration dialog box open. Enter name IP address assigned session, click [OK], running. The changes make saved, QVTNET.INI write-protected. A elegant solution problem dynamic SLIP IP address assignment provided Victor Menayang (victor@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu) Victor uses program bootpq semi-automate qvtnet preparation. Bootpq used inquire assigned IP, saved file called ""myip"". Another file ""noip"" essentially complete QVTNET.INI file lacks IP address. In final step ""myip"" ""noip"" copied single QVTNET.INI file. An example Victor's batch file provided below: ===================================================== slipper com2 pktint.com bootpq -i ""ip=\""%%s\"""" >> myip bootpq -i ""My IP# is: %s"" copy /q net + myip + noip e:\com\qvtnet\qvtnet.ini del /q myip @echo echo echo Ready run WinQVTnet ===================================================== For questions details bootpq, please contact Victor Menayang (victor@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu) QPC Software attempting add BOOTP capability WinQVT/net. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- How use PKTMUX SLIP? PKTMUX work SLIP8250.COM packet driver, crashes immediately used ETHERSL.COM PKTMUX work C/SLIPPER.EXE, C/SLIPPER used ethernet simulation mode. An example configuration shown below: The latest release PKTMUX 1.2c; important use version, want use virtual packet drivers applications like Trumpet Windows (to released shortly). [from AUTOEXEC.BAT] lh c/slipper com1 vec=65 baud=57600 ether (packet driver) lh pktmux 5 65 /5 (pktmux loaded 5 virtual packet drivers) lh pktdrv 7f 65 (first virtual packet driver used QVT/net) lh pktint.com (QVT/net pktint.com) pktdrv 63 65 (PKTDRV use native DOS WinTrumpet) Additional virtual packet drivers loaded directly within Windows 3.1 DOS boxes. For example, PIF file load POPmail directed file ""popmail.bat"". This popmail.bat reads like: pktdrv 60 65 loads virtual packet driver 0x60 cd \popmail popmail cd \ pktdrv 60 /u unloads packet driver 0x60 exit causes DOS window close I similar batch files load DOS TCP/IP applications like PC Gopher. It experience PKTMUX works fine even virtual packet drivers two independent virtual DOS sessions, loaded software interrupt. For example within two different DOS boxes -- one POPmail Gopher, virtual packet driver (pktdrv) loaded 0x60 instance. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- How much PKTMUX degrade performance C/SLIPPER? I V.32bis/V.42bis modem 386-33 running Windows 3.1 reasonably fast video card (ATI Graphics Ultra). Under conditions, I three virtual packet drivers loaded used follows: a) Driver 0x7f -- QVTNet FTP client session b) Driver 0x60 one DOS Window -- CUTCP tn3270 session c) Driver 0x60 another DOS Window -- Trumpet DOS I get FTP transfer rates 0.8 - 1.0 kb/sec transferring compressed files. This rate comparable I get SLIP8250 loaded packet driver, single TCP/IP session active. If CSLIPPER used packet driver single session active, I get transfer rates 1.3 - 1.4 kb/sec files. While 40% degradation performance SLIPPER, benefits able use PKTMUX outweigh performance hit. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- C/SLIPPER ethernet simulation mode In ethernet simulation mode, C/SLIPPER ver 1.3 works applications I tested with. One two applications required ethernet simulation balked C/SLIPPER 1.2, even rare problems resolved ver 1.3 When SLIPPER used ethernet simulation mode, used PKTMUX, I get error message QVTNet Console window reads ""IP:incorrect packet type"" ""IP:bad version number"". This seem prevent QVTnet functioning, although I cannot comment loss performance. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- What DOS TCP/IP application work C/SLIPPER ethernet simulation mode? In rare event find package work C/SLIPPER ethernet simulation mode, first contact author -- Peter Tattam -- PETER@psychnet.psychol.utas.edu.au, let know. Chances fix it. In meanwhile, try following. I know kosher, worked I problems C/SLIPPER ver 1.2 (C/SLIPPER loaded 0x62 described PKTMUX section) I load ETHERSL.COM 0x60, run application terminate ETHERSL.COM This also works within Windows 3.1 virtual DOS boxes. However packet driver like ETHERSL used one virtual DOS box time. So example, batch file run Grateful Med (a medical reference retrieval program developed National Library Medicine). ethersl -w 0x60 -h 4 0x03f8 57600 loads ETHERSLIP cd \gm6 search cd \ termin 0x60 terminates ETHERSLIP exit closes DOS box returns Windows If use method, cautious one thing -- don't active PKTMUX DOS sessions open time. After closing ETHERSL window, run PKTMUX DOS sessions problem. BTW, example -- Grateful Med, works problems C/SLIPPER ver 1.3 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PHONE Script Files: The documentation accompany PHONE, provide good instructions writing script files get PHONE dial SLIP servers University Minnesota server. For example script I use dial CISCO server University I attend. Background: To start SLIP connection, I dial terminal server, login username password. After so, I start SLIP session following command ""slip username-slip.dialin.cwru.edu"", followed password -- again.

"I using JOIN command many years now, mostly good success duplicating unix-style file mounts. You hear lots people cursing JOIN confuse dos APPEND command (a truely gnarly hack), don't believe them. You also hear people saying Microsoft recommends use JOIN. But, Microsoft's Windows 4 Workgroups Resource toolkit, following appears: ""JOIN, MS-DOS utility, works fine Windows Workgroups 3.1 change state joined drives Windows Workgroups 3.1 session. This includes adding removing joined drives within Windows Workgroups. We recommend use JOIN running Windows Setup Windows Workgroups 3.1."" Within caveat, JOIN appears valid windows.

"Hi everyone, I thought people may interested VR software groups: *******Announcing release Multiverse-1.0.2******* Multiverse multi-user, non-immersive, X-Windows based Virtual Reality system, primarily focused entertainment/research. Features: Client-Server based model, using Berkeley Sockets. No limit number users (apart performance). Generic clients. Customizable servers. Hierachical Objects (allowing attachment cameras light sources). Multiple light sources (ambient, point spot). Objects extension code, handle unique functionality, easily attached. Functionality: Client: The client built around 'fast' render loop. Basically changes things told server renders image user's viewpoint. It also provides server information user's actions - communicated clients therefore users. The client designed generic - words don't need develop new client want enter new world. This means resources spent enhancing client software rather adapting it. The adaptations, explained moment, occur servers. This release client software supports following functionality: Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing) Multiple Light Sources Types (Ambient, Point Spot) User Interface Panels Colour Polygonal Rendering Phong Shading (optional wireframe faster frame rates) Mouse Keyboard Input (Some people may disappointed software doesn't support PowerGlove input device - can't, I don't one! This will, however, one first enhancements!) Server(s): This customization take place. The following basic support provided release potential world server developers: Transparent Client Management Client Message Handling This may sound like much, takes away headache accepting terminating clients receiving messages - application writer work assumption things happening locally. Things get interesting object extension functionality. This provided allow animate objects: Server Selectable Extension Installation: What means decide objects extended functionality world. Basically call extension initialisers want. Event Handler Registration: When develop extensions object basically write callback functions events want object respond to. (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE TERMINATE) Collision Detection Registration: If want object respond collision events provide basic information collision detection management software. Your callback activated collision occurs. This software kept separate worldServer applications application developer wants build library extended objects choose. The following need make World Server application: Provide initWorld function: This choose object extensions supported, plus initialization want do. Provide positionObject function: This determine place new client. Provide installWorldObjects function: This load world (.wld) file new client. Provide getWorldType function: This tell new client persona have. Provide animateWorld function: This go wild! At minimum let objects move (by calling move function) let server sleep bit (to avoid outrunning clients). That's it! And prove line counts three world servers I've provided: generic - 81 lines dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due stairs!

Note early use PostScript technology, predating many year's papers listed April 1st SIGGRAPH Program Announcement posted days ago. -- Eric Intersection Between Line Polygon (UNDECIDABLE??), Dave Baraff, Tom Duff From: deb@charisma.graphics.cornell.edu Newsgroups: comp.graphics Keywords: P, NP, Jordan curve separation, Ursyhon Metrization Theorem Organization: Program Computer Graphics I think difficult problem. To start with, lines polygons semi-algebraic sets contain uncountable number points. Here off-the-cuff ideas. First, need check line polygon separated. Now, Jordan curve separation theorem says polygon divides plane exactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions. Thus, line lies completely inside polygon, line lies completely outside polygon, possibly (but rarely happen) line intersects polyon. Now, phrasing question says ""if line intersects polygon"", decision problem. One possibility (the decision model approach) reduce question (well known) problem Q, try solve Q. An answer Q gives answer original decision problem. In recent years, many geometric problems successfully modeled new language called PostScript. (See ""PostScript Language"", Adobe Systems Incorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985). So, given line L polygon P, write PostScript program draws line L polygon P, ""outputs"" answer. By ""output"", mean program executes command called ""showpage"", actually prints page paper containing line polygon. A quick examination paper provides answer reduced problem Q, thus original problem. There two small problems approach. (1) There infinite number ways encode L P reduced problem Q. So, forced invoke Axiom Choice (or equivalently, Zorn's Lemma). But use Axiom Choice regarded serious light days. (2) More importantly, question arises whether PostScript program Q actually output piece paper; words, halt? Now, PostScript expressive enough encode everything Turing Machine might do; thus halting problem (for PostScript) undecidable. It quite possible original problem turn undecidable.

When I installed SLIP computer, I configure modem (14.4 kbs Etronics internal) supply phone number dial reach mainframe. The way works I type ""telnet uicvm"" ""tn3270 uicvm"" (either work) DOS prompt. UICVM node name mainframe. The program dials mainframe, establishes protocol, gives logon screen. ""TELNET"" ""TN3270"" names batch files SLIP directory. I told kermit protocol used session. PROBLEM: I would like able Windows 3.1 I hardly ever use DOS directly. SLIP run Windows. I talked people computer center, suggested I use packet driver called WINPKT.COM SLIP. They gave instructions load I start Windows, modify TCPSTART TCPSTOP batch files (in SLIP directory) ensure would work. I I could run SLIP Windows, problems. For one thing, SLIP would hang phone I exited. I run communi- cations program hang phone reboot computer didn't work. For another, many errors. It often took 3-4 tries connect mainframe. Our computer center support SLIP Windows, I can't keep going back questions. QUESTION: Is SHAREWARE package run Windows SLIP supposed do? I need package expensive, I looking shareware. I heard regular commercial packages this, cost hundreds dollars. These main requirements: 1. Must able run Windows 3.1 2. Must allow VT100 IBM TN3270 terminal emulation 3. Must allow ftp file transfers, since that's kind mainframe allows. No Y-modem Z-modem etc. I believe ftp transfers made kermit protocol, I'm hazy that.

"I get regular questions gamma correction since I go great pains deal properly xli (the image loader program I maintain). Here explanation I often use answer questions. This might suitable inclusion FAQ. Graeme Gill. ########################################################################### ""A note gamma correction images"" Author: Graeme W. Gill graeme@labtam.oz.au Date: 93/5/16 ""What gamma stuff anyway ?"" -------------------------------------- Although would nice think ""an image image"", lot complications. Not whole bunch different image formats (gif, jpeg, tiff etc etc), whole lot technical stuff makes dealing images bit complicated. Gamma one things. If you've ever downloaded images BBS net, you've probably noticed (with image viewing programs) images look ok, look dark, look light. ""Why ?"" may ask. This, gamma correction (or lack it). Why need gamma correction -------------------------------------- Gamma correction needed nature CRTs (cathode ray tubes - monitors usually used viewing images). If sort real live scene turn computer image measuring amount light coming point scene, created ""linear"" un-gamma-corrected image. This good thing many ways manipulate image values image file light (ie. adding multiplying work like real light real world). Now take image file turn pixel value voltage feed CRT, find CRT _doesn't_ give amount light proportional voltage. The amount light coming phosphor screen depends voltage something like this: Light_out = voltage ^ crt_gamma So dump nice linear image CRT, image look much dark. To fix ""gamma correct"" image first. You need opposite CRT image, things cancel out, get want. So image: gamma_corrected_image = image ^ (1/crt_gamma) For CRTs, crt_gamma somewhere 1.0 3.0. If is, seem complicated ----------------------------------------------------- The problem display programs gamma correction. Also sources images give linear images (Video cameras video signals general). Because this, lot images already gamma correction done them, rarely sure much. If try display one images program gamma correction you, image gets corrected twice looks way light. If display one images program doesn't gamma correction, look vaguely right, perfect, gamma correction exactly right particular CRT. Whose fault ----------------------- It really three things. One display programs don't gamma correction properly. Another image formats don't specify standard gamma, don't way recording gamma correction is. The third thing many people understand gamma correction about, create lot images varying gamma's. At least two file formats right thing. The Utah Graphics Toolkit .rle format semi-standard way recording gamma image. The JFIF file standard (that uses JPEG compression) specifies image encoded must gamma 1.0 (ie. linear image - everyone obeys rules). Some image loaders (for instance xli - X11 image utility) allow specify gamma monitor using, individual gamma values image trying view. Other image viewers (eg. xv another X11 image program) utilities (eg. pbm toolkit) provide ways changing gamma image, figure overall gamma correction yourself, allowing undoing gamma correction image has, gamma correction need suite CRT monitor. [ Note xv 2.21 doesn't provide easy way modifying gamma image. You need adjust R, G B curves appropriate gamma ColEdit controls. Altering Intensity HSV controls doesn't right thing, fails take account effect gamma H S. This tends give tint image. ] How I figure viewer does, gamma screen --------------------------------------------------------------------- The simplest way try loading file chkgamma.jpg (provided xli distribution), JFIF jpeg format file containing two grayscale ramps. The ramps chosen look linear human eye, one using continuous tones, using dithering. If viewer right thing gamma corrects images, two ramps look symmetrical, point look equally bright almost exactly half way top bottom. (To find point helps move away little screen, de-focus eyes bit.) If viewer doesn't gamma correction, left hand ramp long dark part short white part, point equal brightness center. If viewer way setting right amount gamma correction display, equal brightness point center increase gamma, decrease center. The value usually around 2.2 [with xli instance, adjust display gamma -dispgamma flag, you've got right, set DISPLAY_GAMMA environment variable .profile] How I figure gamma image ------------------------------------------------- This tricky bit. As general rule seems lot true color (ie. 24 bit, .ppm .jpg) images gamma 1.0 (linear), although many gamma correction. It seems majority pseudo color images (ie. 8 bit images color maps - .gif etc.) gamma corrected degree other. If viewer gamma correction linear images look good, gamma corrected images look light. If viewer doesn't gamma correction, linear images look dark, gamma corrected images ok. Why Linear images sometimes good thing ----------------------------------------------------- One reason many high quality formats (such Video) use gamma correction actually makes better use storage medium. This human eye logarithmic response light, gamma correction similar compression characteristic. This means images could make better use 8 bits per color (for instance), used gamma correction. The implication though, every time want image processing convert 8 bit image 12 linear bits retain accuracy. Since little popular software this, none popular image formats agree standard gamma correction factor, difficult justify gamma corrected images popular level. If image formats standardize particular gamma, image manipulation software takes care use extra precision dealing linearized internal data, gamma corrected distribution images would good thing. (I told Kodak PhotoCD format instance, standard gamma correction factor enables get highest quality bits used hold image).",0

Microstation Imager ------------------- Intergraph (based Huntsville Alabama) sells wide range GIS software/hardware. Microstation base graphics package Imager sits top of. Imager basically image processing package heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor. Feature Description Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine. Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th 5th order models well projective model (warp image vector map another image). RGB IHS IHS RGB conversion. Principal component analysis. Classification: K-means isodata. Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering reverse. Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median, generic. Complex Histogram/Contrast control. Layer Controller: manages 64 images time -- user extract single bands 3 band image create color images combining various individual bands, etc. The package designed remote sensing application (it handle VERY LARGE images) kinds software available GIS applications. Host Configuration Requirements It runs Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar Sun) though rumors (there always rumors) software would ported PC possibly Sun environment. PCI --- A company called PCI, Inc., Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes array software utilities processing, manipulation, use remote sensing data eight ten different ""industry standard"" formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, couple others whose titles I forget. The software available versions MS-DOS, Unix workstations (among HP, Sun, IBM), VMS, quite possibly platforms now. I use VMS version. The ""PCI software"" consists several classes/groups/packages utilities, grouped function operating common ""PCI database"" disk file. The ""Tape I/O"" package set utility programs read various remote-sensing industry tape formats INTO, write formats FROM, ""PCI database"" file; package I use know much about. Other packages display data PCI database one another several PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric bitmap representation image data attached printer, e.g. Epson-type dot-matrix graphics printer. You might spe- cifically interested mathematical operations package: histo- gram Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g. ""multiply channel 1 3, add channel 2, store channel 5""), God knows else -- there's LOT. I don't don't use these, can't say much them; buy packages particular application/interest calls for. Each utility controlled one eight ""parameters,"" read common ""parameter file"" must (in VMS anyway) ""default directory."" Some utilities share parameters use parameter different purpose, get bit confusing setting series operations. The standard PCI environment contains scripting language similar IBM-PC BASIC, allows automate process setting parameters common, complicated, lengthy difficult series utility executions. (In VMS I also invoke utilities independently DCL command procedure.) There's also optional programming library allows write compiled language programs interface (read from/write to) PCI data structures (database file, parameter file). The PCI software designed specifically remote-sensing images, requires level operator expertise that, reach level handle r-s images, figure ways handle things well. For instance, Tape I/O package offers utility reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop Macintosh calls ""raw"") data tape, number different ""interleave"" orders. This turns ideal manipulating graphic-arts industry's ""CT2T"" format, would probably (I haven't tried) handle Targa, on. Above all, however, HAVE TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING screw Nth degree start over. It's worth noting PCI ""database"" file designed contain ""raster"" (image) data, vectors (for overlaying map information entered via digitizing table), land-use, manner information (I observe remote-sensing image tape often contains manner information spectral bands, latitude, longitude, time, date, etc. original satellite pass; go PCI ""database""). I _believe_ workstations built-in display used. On VAX systems OTHER workstations PCI supports couple specific third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems come mind). One MY personal workarounds display program would display directly PCI ""database"" file Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus 24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem. PCI software COULD ""overkill"" case; seems designed ""high end"" applications/users, i.e. Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice (although know gap getting smaller time). It's probably coincidence PCI located Canada, country LOT land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe Canadian government uses PCI software work areas. SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager) -------------------------------- Back 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager) got fair amount use time. That designed Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels across <= 512 lines <= 256 bands); modified version since developed AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer) uses much larger images. Spam none things (rectification, classification, PC IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays). Actually, limited filtering contrast enhancement (stretching). Spam aimed spectral identification clustering. The original Spam uses X SunView display. The AVIRIS version may require VICAR, executive based TAE, may also require frame buffer. I refer people you're interested. PCW requires X display. MAP II ------ Among Mac GIS systems, MAP II distributed John Wiley.

The plotter used. I tested using Windows drivers HP 7570 HP 7574 worked fine. It accepts either A B sized paper. (8.5 x 11 11x17). I figure plotter worth $300 pens worth least another $200 more.. One thing certain, won't need purchase pens quite while... All packaged pens sealed still fresh. The rest capped seem function well. I'd willing sell pens seperate anyone interested them. I'm selling I got HP LaserJet I don't need color. I'd like $350 best offer... -Chert",0
"Ok, everyone cheating.. tests run macro (to load huge drawing, etc...) SAME machine might tell us REAL world results are? I mean, run tests machine different video cards running word, excel, something like see fast cards are? -- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- swyatt@brahms.udel.edu !!! disclaimer...I blame everything someone else",1

"Check Image Pals v1.2 U-Lead (until May, special $99 intro price, 310-523-9393). It basic image processing tools major formats, screen grabbing, allows image files calalogged thumbnail database. It's great!",0
"OK, starting define criteria. I'm afraid haven't actually proved that. You shown aspects MSW3.1 technically inferior systems. As I said earlier, trying say trivially true. But aspects MSW3.1 actually technically superior systems (resource requirements, performace, device support, printer support, GUI etc.) [ BTW, I'd love see studies show UNIX/X easy learn Windows! ] But I might even agree that, balance, MSW3.1 technically inferior competition. This still prove point. Range available applications? Base OS cost? Cost applications? Cost hardware? Multi-platform support? Quality after-sales service? Availability books/training materials? Support visual physical handicaps? Suitability use mobile computing? Quality Documentation?",1
"Well....I don't know competing 3D studio, it's pretty powerful allright. Yes, send e-mail to: imagine-request@email.sp.paramax.com With header something like subscribe. I actually work FAQ (frequently asked questions). We new version next week, want, I could e-mail previous one. It details list etc... well answering basic questions Imagine. Hope helps!",0
": Concerning proposed newsgroup split, I personally favor : this. I learn awful lot aspects graphics reading : group, code hardware algorithms. I think making 5 : different groups wate, result posts : week per group. I kind like convenience one big forum : discussing aspects graphics. Anyone else feel way? : Just curious. : : : Daemon : Yes. I also like knowing go ask question without getting hell putting wrong newsgroup.",0

In order convert objects human-readable format, file specification TDDD included directory objects. There also shareware system called TTDDDLIB (officially hubcap.clemson.edu) convert (ala PBM+) to/from various object formats : Imagine TTDDD (extension TDDD?), OFF, NFF, Rayshade 4.0, vort. Source included Amiga/Unix executables Amiga. Also outputs Framemaker MIF files isometric views Postscript. P3D --- From Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. The P3D uses lisp slight extensions store three-dimensional models. A simple lisp interpreter included P3D release, need access vendor's lisp run software.

Kinsman Precambrian Electronics 29 Falstaff Rd. Rochester, NY 14609 thomask@kodak.com Copyright March 15, 1991 ABSTRACT The format images created use MS Windows 3.0/3.1 applications documented MS Windows Programmer's Reference guide. This guide intended clearify wording specifications, put forth recommendation among various alternatives. Please send updates/corrections/suggestions revisions me. Please thank writing time keeping name document. Thank respect. This document Copyright, 1991, Thomas B. Kinsman. If desired, PostScript version document available. This information free. You get pay for. Don't sue I'm wrong. OVERVIEW The DIB image file format intended ""Device Independent Bitmap"" file format. (What Microsoft means ""Device Independent"" unclear me.) Four pixel resolutions supported: 1 bit, 4 bit, 8 bit, 24 bit pixels. These images intended use DOS (IBM, Little-Endian) systems. If creating another architecture byte- swap short long integer values. By convention, DIB images end extension "".BMP"". This March 15, 1991 - 2 - super-set earlier ""bitmap image files"". Consequently sometimes hear DIB files referred ""BMP"" files. Since DIB images files super-set, three ""flavors"" DIB images: DOS DIB images. These recommended convention, form I describe create. They intended applications running MS Windows /3.0 DOS environment. OS/2 DIB images. My understanding flavor DIB images used Presentation Manager. Old-style Bitmap images. March 15, 1991 - 3 - DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FLAVORS The DOS DIB images consist of: 1. A ""BITMAPFILEHEADER"" file header identifies file DIB file. This header also gives total size image file, offset image data. 2. A ""BITMAPINFOHEADER"" image header specifies image attributes. 3. An optional palette colors used image. If exists, may contain 2, 16, 256 entries. Each entry Windows RGBQUAD structure. 4. The image data itself. The OS/2 DIB images consist of: 1. The ""BITMAPFILEHEADER"" file header identifies file DIB file. This header also gives total size image file, offset image data. 2. A ""BITMAPCOREHEADER"" image header specifies image attributes. 3. An optional palette colors used image. Again, exists may contain 2, 16, 256 entries. Each entry Windows RGBTRIPLE structure. 4. The image data itself. The Old Style image bitmap consists of: 1. Either BITMAPINFOHEADER BITMAPCOREHEADER. Which header type determined first long integer (DWORD) value. 2. An optional color palette. This palette may composed either Windows RGBQUAD structures (if header BITMAPINFOHEADER) Windows RGBTRIPLE structures (if header BITMAPCOREHEADER). 3. The image data itself. CREATING DIB IMAGE FILES. Creating DOS DIB image file consists several straight forward steps. The headers need created written file. These header structures defined MS Windows/3.0 ""windows.h"" include file. Palette information needs stored images 24-bit images. The five general steps are: 1. Filling BITMAPFILEHEADER BITMAPINFOHEADER structures basic image information. 2. If image 1-bit, 4-bit, 8-bit image, creating color palette RGBQUADS. 3. Calculating total file size putting information March 15, 1991 - 4 - ""bfSize"" field BITMAPFILEHEADER. 4. Calculating offset image data start file, putting ""bfOffBits"" field BITMAPFILEHEADER. 5. Writing file BITMAPFILEHEADER, BITMAPINFOHEADER, color palette, image data (in order). The following sections describe structures terms MicroSoft C type- defined keywords. The following table describes keywords familiar MicroSoft C. _______________________________________ | | | Type-defined keywords MicroSoft C.| |______________________________________| | typedef | meaning | |_________|____________________________| | BYTE | unsigned character | | WORD | two byte unsigned integer | | DWORD | four byte unsigned integer| |_________|____________________________| March 15, 1991 - 5 - THE BITMAPFILEHEADER This structure defined ""windows.h"" as: typedef struct tagBITMAPFILEHEADER { WORD bfType; DWORD bfSize; WORD bfReserved1; WORD bfReserved2; DWORD bfOffBits; } BITMAPFILEHEADER; The ""bfType"" field two ascii characters 'B' 'M'. This serves identify file DIB image file. On intel byte ordered machine (IBM compatible), constant formed C quantity ('M' << 8 | 'B') == 0x4d42 intel system. The ""bfSize"" field total size file. For purposes field equal to: size BITMAPFILEHEADER, plus size BITMAPINFOHEADER, plus number entries color palette times size RGBQUAD, plus number bytes image data. If image data written uncompressed form, value calculated ahead time. Otherwise, field needs filled later. Both ""bfReserved1"" ""bfReserved2"" fields always set zero. The ""bfOffBits"" field set offset start image data start file. For purposes, field set to: size BITMAPFILEHEADER, plus size BITMAPINFOHEADER, plus number entries color palette times size RGBQUAD. This works image data written write color palette one exists. March 15, 1991 - 6 - THE BITMAPINFOHEADER This structure defined ""windows.h"" as: typedef struct tagBITMAPINFOHEADER{ DWORD biSize; DWORD biWidth; DWORD biHeight; WORD biPlanes; WORD biBitCount; DWORD biCompression; DWORD biSizeImage; DWORD biXPelsPerMeter; DWORD biYPelsPerMeter; DWORD biClrUsed; DWORD biClrImportant; } BITMAPINFOHEADER; The ""biSize"" field set size BITMAPINFOHEADER structure itself. When reading image file, value used determine image contains BITMAPINFOHEADER BITMAPCOREHEADER. The ""biWidth"" field width image image pixels. The ""biHeight"" field height image image lines. The ""biPlanes"" field always set 1. This data written one color plane. The ""biBitCount"" field bit-depth image. This must either 1, 4, 8, 24, depending bit-depth image data. The ""biCompression"" field tells image data compressed compressed. DIB images support two forms run-length encoding. However, I never seen images use it, don't know yet works. Set field zero (long zero, 0L), indicate data compressed. All subsequent fields BITMAPINFOHEADER structure may set zero. A requirement interpretting software able compute fields necessary previous information. The field might want explicitly specify might ""biClrUsed"". For 4-bit 8-bit images field indicates possible color entries used image contains ""biClrUsed"" colors. If using 32 colors 8-bit image, may want save 32 possible 256 palette entries. Generally, set field zero. March 15, 1991 - 7 - COLOR PALETTES Each entry color palette RGBQUAD structure. The RGBQUAD structure defined ""windows.h"" include file as: typedef struct tagRGBQUAD { BYTE rgbBlue; BYTE rgbGreen; BYTE rgbRed; BYTE rgbReserved; } RGBQUAD; The ""rgbReserved"" field always zero. For color used, amount Blue, Green, Red filled structure structure written file. A value zero ""rgbBlue"", ""rgbGreen"", ""rgbRed"" fields indicates particular component contribute color composition. A value 255 fields indicates component contributes fully color composition. IMAGE DATA There three surprises ordering image data DIB image file. The creator format determined creative, certainly was. Within image data, line written padded next four byte quantity. So, 8-bit image one pixel wide, still write four bytes every image line. The number bytes per line calculated as: bytes_per_line = (width_in_pix * bit_depth + 31 32 * 4; ---or, terms fields BITMAPINFOHEADER structure--- bytes_per_line = (biWidth * biBitCount + 31 32 * 4; When writing image data, must write bottom line first. The bottom line image would look screen first line image data file. For 1-bit, 4-bit, 8-bit images, information written would expect. One bit images padded eight pixels byte. Four bit images padded two pixels byte. Eight bit images written one pixel per byte. Twenty-four bit images written three bytes per pixel. However, 24-bit images information must written order blue, green, red. While image file formats write data March 15, 1991 - 8 - ""RGB"" ordering, DIB image file writes data ""BGR"" ordering. SUMMARY This provide enough information create DIB images applications scanners image exporting routines. If find DIB images, please pass information I modify document accordingly.

If don't get reply, server may misreading return address; add line ""path myname@mysite"" specify correct e-mail address reply to. ---------- [1] What JPEG? JPEG (pronounced ""jay-peg"") standardized image compression mechanism. JPEG stands Joint Photographic Experts Group, original name committee wrote standard. JPEG designed compressing either full-color gray-scale digital images ""natural"", real-world scenes. It work well non-realistic images, cartoons line drawings. JPEG handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, handle motion picture compression. Standards compressing types images worked committees, named JBIG MPEG respectively. JPEG ""lossy"", meaning image get decompression isn't quite identical originally put in. The algorithm achieves much compression exploiting known limitations human eye, notably fact small color details aren't perceived well small details light-and-dark. Thus, JPEG intended compressing images looked humans. If plan machine-analyze images, small errors introduced JPEG may problem you, even invisible eye. A useful property JPEG degree lossiness varied adjusting compression parameters. This means image maker trade file size output image quality. You make *extremely* small files don't mind poor quality; useful indexing image archives, making thumbnail views icons, etc. etc. Conversely, aren't happy output quality default compression setting, jack quality satisfied, accept lesser compression. [2] Why use JPEG? There two good reasons: make image files smaller, store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead 8-bit-per-pixel data. Making image files smaller big win transmitting files across networks archiving libraries images. Being able compress 2 Mbyte full-color file 100 Kbytes makes big difference disk space transmission time! (If comparing GIF JPEG, size ratio like four one. More details below.) If viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll convert JPEG format viewing manipulating images. Even JPEG-capable viewer, takes longer decode view JPEG image view image simpler format (GIF, instance). Thus, using JPEG essentially time/space tradeoff: give time order store transmit image cheaply. It's worth noting network phone transmission involved, time savings transferring shorter file much greater extra time decompress file. I'll let arithmetic yourself. The reason JPEG gradually replace GIF standard Usenet posting format JPEG store full color information: 24 bits/pixel (16 million colors) instead 8 less (256 fewer colors). If 8-bit display hardware may seem like much advantage you. Within couple years, though, 8-bit GIF look obsolete black-and-white MacPaint format today. Furthermore, reasons detailed section 7, JPEG far useful GIF exchanging images among people widely varying color display hardware. Hence JPEG considerably appropriate GIF use Usenet posting standard. [3] When I use JPEG, I stick GIF? JPEG *not* going displace GIF entirely; types images, GIF superior image quality, file size, both. One first things learn JPEG kinds images apply to. As rule thumb, JPEG superior GIF storing full-color gray-scale images ""realistic"" scenes; means scanned photographs similar material. JPEG superior even don't 24-bit display hardware, LOT superior do. (See section 7 details.) GIF significantly better images distinct colors, cartoons line drawings. In particular, large areas pixels *exactly* color compressed efficiently indeed GIF. JPEG can't squeeze files much GIF without introducing visible defects. This sort image best kept GIF form. (In particular, single-color borders quite cheap GIF files, avoided JPEG files.) JPEG also hard time sharp edges: row pure-black pixels adjacent row pure-white pixels, example. Sharp edges tend come blurred unless use high quality setting. Again, sort thing found scanned photographs, shows fairly often GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc. The blurriness particularly objectionable text that's pixels high. If GIF lot small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it. Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, instance) usually fall scanned images cartoons terms complexity. The complex subtly rendered image, likely JPEG well it. The goes semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings such). Plain black-and-white (two level) images never converted JPEG. You need least 16 gray levels JPEG useful gray-scale images. It also noted GIF lossless gray-scale images 256 levels, JPEG not. If existing library GIF images, may wonder whether convert JPEG. You lose little image quality do. (Section 7, argues JPEG image quality superior GIF, applies formats start full-color original. If start GIF, you've already irretrievably lost great deal information; JPEG make things worse.) However, disk space savings may justify converting anyway. This decision you'll make yourself. If convert GIF library JPEG, see section 14 hints. Be prepared leave images GIF format, since GIFs convert well. [4] How well JPEG compress images? Pretty darn well. Here sample file sizes image I handy, 727x525 full-color image ship harbor. The first three files comparison purposes; rest created free JPEG software described section 6B. File Size bytes Comments ship.ppm 1145040 Original file PPM format (no compression; 24 bits 3 bytes per pixel, plus bytes overhead) ship.ppm.Z 963829 PPM file passed Unix compress compress doesn't accomplish lot, you'll note. Other text-oriented compressors give similar results. ship.gif 240438 Converted GIF ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif Most savings result losing color info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, 24. (See sec. 7.) ship.jpg95 155622 cjpeg -Q 95 (highest useful quality setting) This indistinguishable 24-bit original, least nonprofessional eyeballs. ship.jpg75 58009 cjpeg -Q 75 (default setting) You look mighty darn close distinguish original, even on-screen once. ship.jpg50 38406 cjpeg -Q 50 This slight defects; know look for, could tell it's JPEGed without seeing original. Still good image quality many recent postings Usenet pictures groups. ship.jpg25 25192 cjpeg -Q 25 JPEG's characteristic ""blockiness"" becomes apparent setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some). Still, I've seen plenty Usenet postings poorer image quality this. ship.jpg5o 6587 cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize (-optimize cuts table overhead) Blocky, perfectly satisfactory preview indexing purposes. Note file TINY: compression ratio original 173:1 In case JPEG make file that's factor four five smaller GIF comparable quality (the -Q 75 file every bit good GIF, better full-color display). This seems typical ratio real-world scenes. [5] What good ""quality"" settings JPEG? Most JPEG compressors let pick file size vs. image quality tradeoff selecting quality setting. There seems widespread confusion meaning settings. ""Quality 95"" NOT mean ""keep 95% information"", claimed. The quality scale purely arbitrary; it's percentage anything. The name game using JPEG pick lowest quality setting (smallest file size) decompresses image indistinguishable original. This setting vary one image another one observer another, rules thumb. The default quality setting (-Q 75) often best choice. This setting lowest go without expecting see defects typical image. Try -Q 75 first; see defects, go up. Except experimental purposes, never go -Q 95; saying -Q 100 produce file two three times large -Q 95, hardly better quality. If image less perfect quality begin with, might able go -Q 50 without objectionable degradation. On hand, might need go HIGHER quality setting avoid degradation. The second case seems apply much time converting GIFs JPEG. The default -Q 75 right compressing 24-bit images, -Q 85 95 usually better converting GIFs (see section 14 info). If want small file (say preview indexing purposes) prepared tolerate large defects, -Q setting range 5 10 right. -Q 2 may amusing ""op art"". (Note: quality settings discussed article apply free JPEG software described section 6B, many programs based it. Other JPEG implementations, Image Alchemy, may use completely different quality scale. Some programs don't even provide numeric scale, ""high""/""medium""/""low""-style choices.) [6] Where I get JPEG software? Most programs described section available FTP. If don't know use FTP, see FAQ article ""How find sources"". (If don't direct access FTP, read ftpmail servers article.) That article appears regularly news.answers, get sending e-mail mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu ""send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources"" body. The ""Anonymous FTP List FAQ"" may also helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq news.answers archive. NOTE: list changes constantly. If copy couple months old, get latest JPEG FAQ news.answers archive. [6A] If looking ""canned"" software, viewers, etc: The first part list system-specific programs run one kind system. If don't see want machine, check portable JPEG software described end list. Note list concentrates free shareware programs obtain Internet; commercial programs listed too. X Windows: John Bradley's free XV (version 2.00 up) excellent viewer JPEG, GIF, image formats. It's available FTP export.lcs.mit.edu ftp.cis.upenn.edu. The file called 'xv-???.tar.Z' (where ??? version number, currently 2.21); located 'contrib' directory export 'pub/xv' directory upenn. XV reduces images 8 bits internally, means it's real good choice 24-bit display (you'll still get 8-bit color). Also, shouldn't use XV convert full-color images JPEG, they'll get color-quantized first. But XV fine tool converting GIF 8-bit images JPEG. CAUTION: glitch versions 2.21 earlier: sure check ""save normal size"" checkbox saving JPEG file, file blurry. Another good choice X Windows John Cristy's free ImageMagick package, also available export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z. This package handles many image processing conversion tasks. The ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; colormapped displays, better (though slower) color quantization XV basic free JPEG software. Both large, complex packages. If want simple image viewer, try xloadimage xli. xloadimage supports JPEG latest release, 3.03. xloadimage free available export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z. xli variant version xloadimage, said fans somewhat faster robust original. (The current xli indeed faster robust current xloadimage, least respect JPEG files, IJG v4 decoder xloadimage 3.03 using hacked-over v1. The next xloadimage release fix this.) xli also free available export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z. Both programs said right thing 24-bit displays. MS-DOS: This covers plain DOS; Windows OS/2 programs, see next headings. One good choice Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, views JPEG GIF files. The current version, 2.4a, available FTP sunee.uwaterloo.ca (129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip. This good basic viewer works either 286 386/486 machines. The user interface flashy, it's functional. Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview. The current version, 1.2, available Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip. Hiview requires 386 better CPU VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 386MAX work; Windows OS/2 not). Hiview currently fastest viewer images bigger screen. For larger images, scales image fit screen (rather using panning/scrolling viewers do). You may may prefer approach, there's denying slows loading large images considerably. Note: installation bit tricky; read directions carefully! A shareware alternative ColorView DOS ($30). This easier install either two freeware alternatives. Its user interface also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find harder use --- keystrokes, inconsistent behavior. It faster DVPEG little slower Hiview, least hardware. (For images larger screen size, DVPEG ColorView seem speed, faster Hiview.) The current version 2.1, available Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip. Requires VESA graphics driver; don't one, look vesadrv2.zip vesa-tsr.zip directory. (Many recent PCs built-in VESA driver, don't try load VESA driver unless ColorView complains driver missing.) A second shareware alternative Fullview, kicking around net while, I don't know stable archive location it. The current (rather old) version inferior viewers anyway. The author tells new version Fullview shortly submitted Simtel20 archives time. The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG latest revision, 8.60a. However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't good: it's slow (about half speed viewers) image quality poor except hi-color displays. Too bad ... it'd nice see good JPEG capability CSHOW. Shareware, $25. Available Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip. Due remarkable variety PC graphics hardware, one viewers might work particular machine. If can't get *any* work, you'll need use one following conversion programs convert JPEG GIF, view favorite GIF viewer. (If hi-color hardware, don't use GIF intermediate format; try find TARGA-capable viewer instead. VPIC5.0 reputed right thing hi-color displays.) The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters FTPable Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or jpeg4386.zip 386 extended memory). These files DOS compilations free source code described section 6B; convert JPEG GIF, Targa, PPM formats. Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF. These slow limited conversion GIF format; particular, can't get 24-bit color output JPEG. The major advantage tools read write HSI's proprietary JPEG format well Usenet-standard JFIF format. Since HSI-format files rather widespread BBSes, useful capability. Version 2.0 tools free (prior versions shareware). Get Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip. NOTE: use HSI format files posted Internet, since readable non-PC platforms. Handmade Software also shareware image conversion manipulation package, Image Alchemy. This translate JPEG files (both JFIF HSI formats) many image formats. It also display images. A demo version Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 available Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip. NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site PC-related programs Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20). Simtel20 runs non-Unix system weird directory names; document refers directory (eg) ""msdos/graphics"" Simtel20, really means ""pd1:<msdos.graphics>"". If physically MILnet, expect rather slow FTP transfer rates Simtel20. There several Internet sites maintain copies (mirrors) Simtel20 archives; FTP users go one mirror sites instead. A popular USA mirror site oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), keeps Simtel20 files (eg) ""/pub/msdos/graphics"". If FTP capability, retrieve files Simtel20 e-mail; see informational postings comp.archives.msdos.announce find how. If outside USA, consult newsgroup learn nearest Simtel20 mirror is. Microsoft Windows: There several Windows programs capable displaying JPEG images. (Windows viewers generally slower DOS viewers hardware, due Windows' system overhead. Note run DOS conversion programs described inside Windows DOS window.) The newest entry WinECJ, free EXTREMELY fast. Version 1.0 available ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip. Requires Windows 3.1 256-or-more-colors mode. This no-frills viewer bad habit hogging machine completely decodes; image quality noticeably worse viewers. But it's fast you'll use anyway, least previewing... JView freeware, fairly fast, good on-line help, write decompressed image Windows BMP format; can't create new JPEG files, doesn't view GIFs. JView also lacks useful features shareware viewers (such brightness adjustment), it's excellent basic viewer. The current version, 0.9, available ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip. (Mirrors archive found Internet sites, including wuarchive.wustl.edu.) WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, BMP image files; write formats too, used converter. It nifty features including color-balance adjustment slideshow. The current version 2.1, available Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip. (This slow 286-compatible version; register, you'll get 386-only version, roughly 25% faster.) ColorView another shareware entry ($30). This early promising contender, updated time, point real advantages WinJPEG. If want try anyway, current version 0.97, available ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip. (I understand new version appearing authors finished ColorView DOS.) DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works Windows, full-screen mode, window. OS/2: The following files available hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).

Shareware, $20. Macintosh: Most Mac JPEG programs rely Apple's JPEG implementation, part QuickTime system extension; need QuickTime installed. To use QuickTime, need 68020 better CPU need running System 6.0.7 later. (If you're running System 6, must also install 32-bit QuickDraw extension; built-in System 7.) You get QuickTime FTP ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx. (As 11/92, file contains QuickTime 1.5, better QT 1.0 several ways. With respect JPEG, marginally faster considerably less prone crash fed corrupt JPEG file. However, applications seem compatibility problems QT 1.5.) Mac users keep mind QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format. (See section 10 details.) If post images Usenet, make sure JFIF format. Most programs mentioned generate either format. The first choice probably JPEGView, free program viewing images JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, GIF format. It also convert two JPEG formats. The current version, 2.0, big improvement prior versions. Get sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx. Requires System 7 QuickTime. On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces best color image quality currently available Mac JPEG viewers. JPEGView view large images much less memory Mac viewers; fact, it's one deal JPEG images much 640x480 pixels typical 4MB Mac. Given large image, JPEGView automatically scales fit screen, rather presenting scroll bars like viewers. (You zoom desired portion, though.) Some people like behavior, don't. Overall, JPEGView's user interface well thought out. GIFConverter, shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF PICT/JPEG, well GIF several image formats. The latest version 2.3.2. Get sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx. Requires System 6.0.5 later. GIFConverter better JPEGView plain JPEG/GIF viewer, much extensive image manipulation format conversion capabilities, may find worth shareware fee lot playing around images. Also, newest version GIFConverter load save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, best bet machine old run QuickTime. (But it's faster QuickTime.) Note: If GIFConverter runs memory trying load large JPEG, try converting file GIF JPEG Convert, viewing GIF version. JPEG Convert, Mac version free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, available sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx. This run Mac, file conversion, viewing. You use conjunction GIF viewer. Previous versions FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, JPEG<=>GIF converter based old version IJG code. If using program, definitely replace JPEG Convert. Apple's free program PictPixie view images JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, GIF format, convert formats. You get PictPixie ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx. Requires QuickTime. PictPixie intended developer's tool, it's really best choice unless like fool around QuickTime. Some drawbacks requires lots memory, produces relatively poor color image quality anything less 24-bit display, relatively unfriendly user interface. Worse, PictPixie unsupported program, meaning minor bugs Apple intend fix. (There old version PictPixie, called PICTCompressor, floating around net. If trash it, it's even buggier. Also, QuickTime Starter Kit includes much cleaned-up descendant PictPixie called Picture Compressor. Note Picture Compressor NOT free may distributed net.) Storm Technology's Picture Decompress free JPEG viewer/converter. This rather old program inferior programs many ways, run without System 7 QuickTime, may forced use older systems. (It need 32-bit QuickDraw, really old machines can't use it.) You get sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx. You must set file type downloaded image file 'JPEG' allow Picture Decompress open it. If machine old run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus instance), GIFConverter choice single-program JPEG viewing. If don't want pay GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert free GIF viewer. More commercial Mac applications supporting JPEG, although deal Usenet-standard JFIF format. Adobe Photoshop, version 2.0.1 later, read write JFIF-format JPEG files (use JPEG plug-in Acquire menu). You must set file type downloaded JPEG file 'JPEG' allow Photoshop recognize it. Amiga: (Most programs listed section stored AmiNet archive amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80). There many mirror sites archive try use closest one. In USA, good choice wuarchive.wustl.edu; look /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...) HamLab Plus excellent JPEG viewer/converter, well general image manipulation tool. It's cheap (shareware, $20) read several formats besides JPEG. The current version 2.0.8. A demo version available amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha. The demo version crop images larger 512x512, otherwise fully functional. Rend24 (shareware, $30) image renderer display JPEG, ILBM, GIF images. The program used create animations, even capturing frames on-the-fly rendering packages like Lightwave. The current version 1.05, available amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha. (Note: although directory supposedly AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, program also run AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 2.1.) Viewtek free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer. The current version 1.04, available amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha. If you're willing spend real money, several commercial packages support JPEG. Two written Thomas Krehbiel, author Rend24 Viewtek. These CineMorph, standalone image morphing package, ImageFX, impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting, effects prepress package also includes CineMorph. Both distributed Great Valley Products. Art Department Professional (ADPro), ASDG Inc, widely used commercial image manipulation software Amigas. ImageMaster, Black Belt Systems, another well-regarded commercial graphics package JPEG support. The free IJG JPEG software available compiled Amigas amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) directory amiga/gfx/conv, file AmigaJPEGV4.lha. These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats. The Amiga world heavily infested quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many based ancient beta-test version free IJG JPEG software (thanks certain magazine published disk-of-the-month, without much notifying authors). Among ""AugJPEG"", ""NewAmyJPEG"", ""VJPEG"", probably others I even heard of. In opinion, anything older IJG version 3 (March 1992) worth disk space it's stored on; program, trash get something newer. Atari ST: The free IJG JPEG software available compiled Atari ST, TT, etc, atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo. These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats. I heard free shareware JPEG-capable viewer Ataris, surely must one now? Pointers appreciated. Acorn Archimedes: !ChangeFSI, supplied RISC OS 3 version 3.10, convert view JPEG JFIF format. Provision also made convert images JPEG, although must done CLI rather double-clicking. Recent versions (since 7.11) shareware program Translator handle JPEG, along 30 image formats. While older versions found Archimedes bboards, current version available registering author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede, The Netherlands. Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 10 pounds). There's also commercial product called !JPEG provides JPEG read/write functionality direct JPEG viewing, well host image format conversion processing options. This expensive necessarily better programs. Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST, Cambridge, UK. Tel: 0223 841099. Portable software almost system: If none fits situation, obtain compile free JPEG conversion software described 6B. You'll also need viewer program. If display 8 bits less, GIF viewer fine; display color capability, try find viewer read Targa PPM 24-bit image files. There numerous commercial JPEG offerings, popping every day. I recommend spend money one unless find available free shareware software vastly slow. In case, purchase hardware-assisted product. Ask pointed questions whether product complies final JPEG standard whether handle JFIF file format; many earliest commercial releases never compatible anyone else's files. [6B] If looking source code work with: Free, portable C code JPEG compression available Independent JPEG Group, I lead. A package containing source code, documentation, small test files available several places. The ""official"" archive site source code ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9 192.48.96.9). Look directory /graphics/jpeg; current release jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z. (This compressed TAR file; don't forget retrieve binary mode.) You retrieve file FTP UUCP. If PC don't know cope .tar.Z format, may prefer ZIP format, find Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip. This file also available CompuServe, GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, jpsrc4.zip. If FTP access, retrieve source nearest comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared issues 55-72 volume 34. (If don't know retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see FAQ article ""How find sources"", referred top section 6.) The free JPEG code provides conversion JPEG ""JFIF"" format image files GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, Truevision Targa file formats. The core compression decompression modules easily reused programs, image viewers. The package highly portable; tested many machines ranging PCs Crays. We released software noncommercial commercial use. Companies welcome use basis JPEG-related products. We ask royalty, although ask acknowledgement product literature (see README file distribution details). We hope make software industrial-quality --- although, anything that's free, offer warranty accept liability. The Independent JPEG Group volunteer organization; you'd like contribute improving software, welcome join. [7] What's hoopla color quantization? Most people don't full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware. Typical display hardware stores 8 fewer bits per pixel, display 256 fewer distinct colors time. To display full-color image, computer must map image appropriate set representative colors. This process called ""color quantization"". (This something misnomer, ""color selection"" would better term. We're stuck standard usage though.) Clearly, color quantization lossy process. It turns images, details color quantization algorithm MUCH impact final image quality errors introduced JPEG (except lowest JPEG quality settings). Since JPEG full-color format, converting color JPEG image display 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization. This true *all* color JPEGs: even feed 256-or-less-color GIF JPEG, comes decompressor *not* 256 colors, thousands colors. This happens JPEG's lossiness affects pixel little differently, two pixels started identical colors probably come slightly different colors. Each original color gets ""smeared"" group nearby colors. Therefore quantization always required display color JPEG colormapped display, regardless image source. The way avoid quantization ask gray-scale output. (Incidentally, effect it's nearly meaningless talk number colors used JPEG image. Even attempted count number distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give different results roundoff error differences. I occasionally see posted images described ""256-color JPEG"". This tells poster (a) hasn't read FAQ (b) probably converted JPEG GIF. JPEGs classified color gray-scale (just like photographs), number colors isn't useful concept JPEG.) On hand, GIF image definition already quantized 256 fewer colors. (A GIF *does* definite number colors palette, format doesn't allow 256 palette entries.) For purposes Usenet picture distribution, GIF advantage sender precomputes color quantization, recipients don't to. This also *disadvantage* GIF: you're stuck sender's quantization. If sender quantized different number colors display, re-quantize, resulting much poorer image quality quantized full-color image. Furthermore, sender didn't use high-quality color quantization algorithm, you're luck. For reason, JPEG offers promise significantly better image quality users whose machines don't match sender's display hardware. JPEG's full color image quantized precisely match user's display hardware. Furthermore, able take advantage future improvements quantization algorithms (there lot active research area), purchase better display hardware, get better view JPEG images already have. With GIF, you're stuck forevermore sent. It's also worth mentioning many GIF-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines. If view 256-color GIF 16-color EGA display, example, probably getting much worse image need to. This partly inevitable consequence two color quantizations (one create GIF, one display it), often it's also due sloppiness. JPEG conversion programs forced use high quality quantizers order get acceptable results all, normal use quantize directly number colors displayed. Thus, JPEG likely provide better results average GIF program low-color-resolution displays well high-resolution ones! Finally, ever-growing number people better-than-8-bit display hardware already: 15-bit ""hi-color"" PC displays, true 24-bit displays workstations Macintoshes, etc. For people, GIF already obsolete, cannot represent image full capabilities display. JPEG images drive displays much effectively. Thus, JPEG all-around better choice GIF representing images machine-independent fashion. [8] How JPEG work? The buzz-words know chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine transforms, coefficient quantization, Huffman arithmetic entropy coding. This article's long enough already, I'm going say here. For technical information, see comp.compression FAQ. This available news.answers archive rtfm.mit.edu, files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3]. If need help using news.answers archive, see top article. [9] What lossless JPEG? There's great deal confusion subject. The JPEG committee define truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one guarantees final output bit-for-bit identical original input. However, lossless mode almost nothing common regular, lossy JPEG algorithm, offers much less compression. At present, implementations lossless JPEG exist, commercial. Saying ""-Q 100"" free JPEG software DOES NOT get lossless image. What get rid deliberate information loss coefficient quantization step. There still good deal information loss color subsampling step. (With V4 free JPEG code, also say ""-sample 1x1"" turn subsampling. Keep mind many commercial JPEG implementations cannot cope resulting file.) Even quantization subsampling turned off, regular JPEG algorithm lossless, subject roundoff errors various calculations. The maximum error counts one pixel value; it's highly unlikely could perceived human eye, might concern machine processing image. At minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files perhaps half size uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image. True lossless JPEG provides roughly amount compression, guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy. If application requiring lossless storage images less 6 bits per pixel (per color component), may want look JBIG bilevel image compression standard. This performs better JPEG lossless images. JPEG lossless superior JBIG images 6 bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG public domain (at least Huffman back end), JBIG techniques heavily covered patents. [10] Why argument file formats? Strictly speaking, JPEG refers family compression algorithms; *not* refer specific image file format. The JPEG committee prevented defining file format turf wars within international standards organizations. Since can't actually exchange images anyone else unless agree common file format, leaves us problem. In absence official standards, number JPEG program writers gone ""do thing"", result programs aren't compatible anybody else's. The closest thing de-facto standard JPEG format work that's coordinated people C-Cube Microsystems. They defined two JPEG-based file formats: * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), ""low-end"" format transports pixels much else. * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, extension Aldus TIFF format. TIFF ""high-end"" format let record everything ever wanted know image, lot besides :-). TIFF lot complex JFIF, may well prove less transportable, different vendors historically implemented slightly different incompatible subsets TIFF. It's likely adding JPEG mix anything improve situation. Both formats developed input major vendors JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely future commercial products adhere one standards. I believe Usenet adopt JFIF replacement GIF picture postings. JFIF simpler TIFF available now; TIFF 6.0 spec recently officially adopted, still unusably vague crucial details. Even TIFF/JPEG well defined, JFIF format likely widely supported ""lowest common denominator""; TIFF/JPEG files may never transportable. A particular case people may interested Apple's QuickTime software Macintosh. QuickTime uses JFIF-compatible format wrapped inside Mac-specific PICT structure. Conversion JFIF QuickTime JPEG pretty straightforward, several Mac programs available (see Mac portion section 6A). If editor handles binary files, strip QuickTime JPEG PICT JFIF hand; see section 11 details. Another particular case Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF Image Alchemy). These programs capable reading writing JFIF format. By default, though, write proprietary format developed HSI. This format NOT readable non-HSI programs used Usenet postings. Use -j switch get JFIF output. (This applies old versions programs; current releases emit JFIF format default. You still careful post HSI-format files, unless want get flamed people non-PC platforms.) [11] How I recognize file format I have, I it? If alleged JPEG file software won't read, it's likely HSI format proprietary JPEG-based format. You tell inspecting first bytes file: 1. A JFIF-standard file start characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0, followed two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed 'JFIF'. 2. If see FF D8 start, rest it, may ""raw JPEG"" file. This probably decodable as-is JFIF software --- it's worth try, anyway. 3. HSI files start 'hsi1'. You're luck unless HSI software. Portions file may look like plain JPEG data, won't decompress properly non-HSI programs. 4. A Macintosh PICT file, JPEG-compressed, couple hundred bytes header followed JFIF header (scan 'JFIF'). Strip everything FF D8 able read it. 5. Anything else: it's proprietary format, JPEG all. If lucky, file may consist header raw JPEG data stream. If identify start JPEG data stream (look FF D8), try stripping everything that. In uuencoded Usenet postings, characteristic JFIF pattern ""begin"" line M_]C_X ... whereas uuencoded HSI files start ""begin"" line M:'-I ... If learn check former, save trouble downloading non-JFIF files. [12] What arithmetic coding? The JPEG spec defines two different ""back end"" modules final output compressed data: either Huffman coding arithmetic coding allowed. The choice impact image quality, arithmetic coding usually produces smaller compressed file. On typical images, arithmetic coding produces file 5 10 percent smaller Huffman coding. (All file-size numbers previously cited Huffman coding.) Unfortunately, particular variant arithmetic coding specified JPEG standard subject patents owned IBM, AT&T, Mitsubishi. Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless obtain licenses companies. (The ""fair use"" doctrine allows people implement test algorithm, actually storing images dubious best.) At least short run, I recommend people worry arithmetic coding; space savings isn't great enough justify potential legal hassles. In particular, arithmetic coding *should not* used images exchanged Usenet. There small chance legal situation may change future. Stay tuned details. [13] Does loss accumulate repeated compression/decompression? It would nice if, compressed image JPEG, could decompress it, manipulate (crop border, say), recompress without image degradation beyond lost initially. Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE. In general, recompressing altered image loses information, though usually much lost first time around. The next best thing would decompress image recompress *without changing it* loss, i.e., get identical JPEG file. Even true; least, current free JPEG software. It's essentially problem accumulation roundoff error. If repeatedly compress decompress, image eventually degrade see visible changes first-generation output. (It usually takes many cycles get visible change.) One things to-do list see accumulation error avoided limited, I optimistic it. In case, could possibly guaranteed would compressing unmodified full-color output djpeg, original quality setting, would introduce loss. Even simple changes cropping border could cause roundoff-error degradation. (If you're wondering why, it's pixel-block boundaries move. If cropped multiples 16 pixels, might safe, that's mighty limited capability!) The bottom line JPEG useful format archival storage transmission images, don't want use intermediate format sequences image manipulation steps. Use lossless format (PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) working image, JPEG ready file away. Aside avoiding degradation, save lot compression/decompression time way :-). [14] What rules thumb converting GIF images JPEG? As stated earlier, *will* lose amount image information convert existing GIF image JPEG. If obtain original full-color data GIF made from, it's far better make JPEG that. But need save space GIF work from, suggestions getting maximum space savings minimum loss quality. The first rule converting GIF library look JPEG, make sure happy it, throwing away corresponding GIF; give chance re-do conversion higher quality setting necessary. Some GIFs may better left GIFs, explained section 3; particular, cartoon-type GIFs sixteen fewer colors don't convert well. You may find JPEG file reasonable quality *larger* GIF. (So check sizes too.) Experience date suggests large, high-visual-quality GIFs best candidates conversion JPEG. They chew storage offer potential savings, convert JPEG least degradation. Don't waste time converting GIF much 100 Kbytes. Also, don't expect JPEG files converted GIFs small created directly full-color originals. To maintain image quality may let converted files much twice big straight-through JPEG files would (i.e., shoot 1/2 1/3rd size GIF file, 1/4th suggested earlier comparisons). Many people developed odd habit putting large constant-color border around GIF image. While useless, nearly free terms storage cost GIF files. It NOT free JPEG files, sharp border boundary create visible artifacts (""ghost"" edges). Do favor crop border JPEGing. (If X Windows system, XV's manual automatic cropping functions painless way this.) cjpeg's default Q setting 75 appropriate full-color input, GIF inputs, Q settings 85 95 often seem necessary avoid image degradation. (If apply smoothing suggested below, higher Q setting may necessary.) Color GIFs photographs complex artwork usually ""dithered"" fool eye seeing 256 colors GIF actually store. If enlarge image, see adjacent pixels often significantly different colors; normal size eye averages pixels together produce illusion intermediate color value. The trouble dithering that, JPEG, looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise; JPEG can't compress noise well. The resulting JPEG file larger lower image quality would gotten JPEGing original full color image (if it). To get around this, want ""smooth"" GIF image compression. Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating color thought saw anyway, process getting rid rapid color changes give JPEG trouble. Appropriate use smoothing often let avoid using high Q factor, thus reducing size compressed file, still obtaining better-looking output image you'd get without smoothing. With V4 free JPEG software (or products based it), simple smoothing capability built in. Try ""-smooth 10"" converting GIFs. Values 10 25 seem work well high-quality GIFs. Heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors. (If see regular fine-scale patterns GIF image even without enlargement, strong smoothing definitely called for.) Too large smoothing factor blur output image, don't want. If image processing wizard, also smoothing separate filtering program, pnmconvol PBMPLUS package. However, cjpeg's built-in smoother LOT faster pnmconvol... The upshot ""cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10"" probably good starting point converting GIFs. But really care image, you'll want check results maybe try settings. --------------------- For information JPEG general free JPEG software particular, contact Independent JPEG Group jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.",0

I captured raw footage resolution 384*288 pixels Spigot card Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution PAL source). I imported Premiere put Compact Video compressor, keeping 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions movie: one scaled 320*240 resolution, 160*120 resolution. I used default ""2.00"" quality setting Premiere 2.0.1, specified key frame every ten frames. I ran 320*240 movie ""Raw Speed Test"" program I used results I'd reporting earlier. Result: playback rate 45 frames per second. That's right, I getting much higher result first short test movie. Just fun, I copied 320*240 movie external hard disk (a Quantum LP105S), ran there. This time playback rate 35 frames per second. Obviously 230MB internal hard disk (also Quantum) significant contributor speed playback. I modified speed test program allow specification optional scaling factors, tried playing back 160*120 movie scaled 320*240 size. This time playback speed 60 fps. Clearly, poster observed poor performance scaled playback seeing QuickTime 1.0 action, 1.5. I'd try tests QuickTime 1.0, I don't think it's entirely compatible Centris System 7.1... Unscaled, playback rate 160*120 movie 100 fps. The thing I tried saving versions 320*240 movie ""preferred"" playback rates greater 1.0, seeing well played within MoviePlayer (ie QuickTime's normal synchronized playback). A preferred rate 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn't work well: playback jerky. Compare raw speed test, achieved 45 fps ease. I can't believe QuickTime's synchronization code would add much overhead: I think slowdown coming Mac system's task switching. A preferred rate 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed work fine: I couldn't see evidence stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight stutter, four key frames every second, hard tell. I guess I could try recreating movies longer interval key frames, make stutter noticeable. Of course, also improve compression slightly, speed playback performance even more...

(2) type scaling (QT optimized ""double size"" scaling, scaling factors hit peformance much harder). (3) playback window position (MoviePlayer limits window placement choices advantagous pixel boundaries default, I'm sure Premiere). Any combination radically alter playback performance. Image size is, course, another biggie. Giving movie player lots RAM also make real difference. Forgive mentioned earlier thread... -Peter Lee",0

"[ description experiment deleted ] [ deleted ] A years ago friend I took 256 grey-level photos 1 bit Mac Plus screen using method. Displaying 256 levels synchronized 60Hz display took 10 seconds. After experimenting different aperture settings screen brightnesses found range worked well, giving respectable contrast. The quality images pretty good. There visible contrast bands. To minimize exposure time display program built 255 different 1 bit frames. The first contained dot pixels value 255, second pixels value 254, etc. These frames stored using sparse data structure fast 'or' onto screen sequence. Creating frames sometimes took 5-10 minutes old Mac, camera shutter closed time anyway. And yes, wrote directly screen memory. Mea culpa. Our biggest problem small images displayed top left corner screen instead center. It took extra week film developed printed, processors took trouble manually move images center print. Who'd guessed?",0

The simple answer is, divide depth. For verbose explanation, see references, starting with: The Foley Van Dam Feiner Hughes ""Computer Graphics"" book certainly good start. Chapter 6 ""Viewing 3D"", read chapter 15, ""Visible-Surface Determination"". For information go chapter 16 shading, chapter 19 clipping, branch there. 3) Quantizing 24 bit images 8 bits. Find copy ""Color Image Quantization Frame Buffer Display"" Paul Heckbert, SIGGRAPH '82 Proceedings, page 297. There algorithms, one works well fairly simple. Implementations included raster toolkits (see item 7 below). A variant method described ""Graphics Gems"", p. 287-293. Note code ""Graphics Gems"" series available FTP site, described above. Check John Bradley's ""Diversity Algorithm"", incorporated xv package described back manual. The ImageMagick package (see section 7 is) contains another quantizing algorithm presented ""doing better job algorithms, slower"". There's also implementation of: Wan, Wong, Prusinkiewicz, _An Algorithm Multidimensional Data Clustering_, Transactions Mathematical Software, Vol. 14 #2 (June, 1988), pp. 153-162. avialable princeton.edu:pub/Graphics/colorquant.shar. This code, modified form, appears Utah Raster Toolkit well. 4) Converting color grayscale. The NTSC formula is: luminosity = .299 red + .587 green + .114 blue 5) Quantizing grayscale black&white. The reference need stuff is: Digital Halftoning, Robert Ulichney, MIT Press 1987, ISBN 0-262-21009-6 But go start coding, check image manipulation software mentioned item 7 below. All packages mentioned form gray b&w conversion. 6) Rotating raster image arbitrary angle. The obvious wrong method loop pixels source image, transform coordinate, copy pixel destination. This wrong leaves holes destination. Instead, loop pixels destination image, apply *reverse* transformation coordinates, copy pixel source. This method quite general, used one-to-one 2-D mapping, rotation. You add anti-aliasing sub-pixel sampling. However, much faster method, antialising included, involves three shear operations. The method originally created IM Raster Toolkit (see below); implementation also present PBMPLUS. Reference: ""A Fast Algorithm Raster Rotation"", Alan Paeth (awpaeth@watcgl.waterloo.edu) Graphics Interface '86 (Vancouver). An article IM toolkit appears journal. An updated version rotation paper appears ""Graphics Gems"" (see section [1]) original title. 7) Free image manipulation software. There number toolkits converting one image format another, simple image manipulations size scaling, plus above-mentioned 24 -> 8, color -> gray, gray -> b&w conversions.

There number automated mail servers send things like response message. See item 13 details some. Also, newsgroup alt.graphics.pixutils specifically discussion software like this. You may find useful information there. 8) Format documents TIFF, IFF, BIFF, NFF, OFF, FITS, etc. You almost certainly don't need these. Read item 7 free image manipulation software. Get one packages look them. Chances excellent image converter going write already there. But still want one format documents, many files available anonymous ftp zamenhof.cs.rice.edu directory pub/graphics.formats. These files collected net believed correct. This archive includes pixel formats, two- three-dimensional object formats. The future archive uncertain moment, Mark Hall <foo@cs.rice.edu> apparently longer maintaining it. A second graphics file format archive actively maintained Quincey Koziol (koziol@ncsa.uiuc.edu). The latest version exists ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu /misc/file.formats/graphics.formats. Apparently, neither complete, might want check both. FITS stands Flexible Image Transport System. It's file format often used astronomy. Despite name, contain images things well. There regular monthly FITS basics information posting sci.astro.fits - read want know more. 9) Converting vector formats. A lot people ask converting HPGL PostScript, MacDraw CGM, whatever. It important understand different problem image format conversions item 7. Converting one image format another fairly easy problem, since get past file header junk, pixel pixel -- basic objects image formats. This vector formats. The basic objects -- circles, ellipses, drop-shadowed pattern-filled round-cornered rectangles, etc. -- vary one format another. Except extremely restricted cases, simply possible one-to-one conversion vector formats. There software converting CGM files ftp.psc.edu. The contributor states runs Unix, MS-Windows, possibly Mac. A better, specific blurb would welcome. On hand, quite possible close approximation, rendering image one format using primitives another. As far I know, one put together general toolkit converters, two different HPGL PostScript converters posted comp.sources.misc. Check index nearest archive site. A related frequent question convert vector format bitmapped image - PostScript Sun raster format, HPGL X11 bitmap. For example, commercial PostScript clones PC's allow render disk file well printer. Also, PostScript interpreters NeXT box Sun's X11/NeWs used render file you're clever. But general, answer no. However, someone put together vector vector conversion toolkit, adding vector raster converter would trivial. GNU ghostscript (from FSF - current version 2.5.2) includes drivers ppm gif format files, thus used PostScript ppm PostScript GIF filter. (It implements essentially PostScript level 1 alot Display PostScript level 2). 10) How get Pixar films. The various John Lasseter Pixar computer animated shorts available video tape. You order Direct Cinema Limited: Film Individual Price Institutional Price Luxo, Jr. $14.95 $50.00 Red's Dream $19.95 $75.00 Tin Toy $24.95 $75.00 Knickknack $24.95 $75.00 Luxo, Jr./Red's Dream/Tin Toy $39.95 $100.00 All tapes 1/2"" VHS NTSC.

That sale price. You get slightly normally. ($35 maybe.) I believe it's available RenderMan Retail (at Pixar's address). Pixar 1001 West Cutting Blvd. Richmond, CA. 94804 (510) 236-4000 (510) 236-0388 (FAX) You obtain video directly Pixar contains ""Luxo, Jr."", ""Red's Dream"", ""Tin Toy"" ""Knicknack"" $25.00, plus $2.50 shipping. They take order phone via FAX major credit card. I ordered mine last week received several days later. Don't expect able rent copy local video store. According license agreement printed back cover case, cannot rented. 11) How I draw circle Bezier (or B-spline) curve? The short answer is, ""You can't."" Unless use rational spline approximate circle. The approximation may look acceptable, sensitive scale. Magnify scale error approximation magnifies. Deviations circularity visible small become glaring large. If want job right, consult article: ""A Menagerie Rational B-Spline Circles"" Leslie Piegl Wayne Tiller IEEE Computer Graphics Applications, volume 9, number 9, September, 1989, pages 48-56. For rough, non-rational approximations, consult book: Computational Geometry Design Manufacture I. D. Faux M. J. Pratt, Ellis Horwood Publishers, Halsted Press, John Wiley 1980. For best known non-rational approximations, consult article: ""Good Approximation Circles Curvature-continuous Bezier Curves"" Tor Dokken, Morten Daehlen, Tom Lyche, Knut Morken Computer Aided Geometric Design, volume 7, numbers 1-4 (combined), June, 1990, pages 33-41 [Elsevier Science Publishers (North-Holland)] 12) How order standards documents. The American National Standards Institute sells ANSI standards, also ISO (international) standards. Their sales office 1-212-642-4900, mailing address 1430 Broadway, NY NY 10018. It helps complete name number. Some useful numbers know: CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) ISO 8632-4 (1987). GKS (Graphical Kernel System) ANSI X3.124-1985. PHIGS (Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System) ANSI X3.144-1988. IGES ASME/ANSI Y14.26M-1987. Language bindings often separate related numbers; example, GKS FORTRAN binding X3.124.1-1985. Standards-in-progress made available key milestones solicit comments graphical public (this includes you!). ANSI let know order them; available Global Engineering 1-800-854-7179. 13) How FTP email. There number sites archive Usenet sources newsgroups make available via email query system. You send message automated server saying something like ""send comp.sources.unix/fbm"", hours days later get file mail. In addition, least one FTP-by-mail server. Send mail ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com saying ""help"" tell use it. Note service times turned due abuse. 14) How tell whether point within planar polygon. Consider ray originating point interest continuing infinity. If crosses odd number polygon edges along way, point within polygon. If ray crosses even number edges, point either outside polygon, within interior hole formed intersecting polygon edges. This idea known trade Jordan curve theorem; see Eric Haines' article Glassner's ray tracing book (above) information, including treatment special cases. Another method sum absolute angles point vertices polygon. If sum 2 pi, point inside, sum 0 point outside. However, method order magnitude slower previous method evaluating trigonometric functions usually quite costly. Code methods (plus barycentric triangle testing) found Ray Tracing News, Vol. 5, No. 3, available princeton.edu: pub/Graphics/RTNews/RTNv5n3.Z. 15) How tessellate sphere. One simple way recursive subdivision triangles. The base recursion octahedron, level divides triangle four smaller ones. Jon Leech <leech@cs.unc.edu> posted nice routine called sphere.c generates coordinates. It's available FTP ftp.ee.lbl.gov princeton.edu. 16) Specific references ray-tracing global illumination.

"I would like see serious discussion best way install windows Novell administrator's point view. I got phone MS Access support told (Microsoft) decided implement, standard software support, LOCAL setup (described below) ""most advantageous installation"". If true Microsoft deems prudent installation I comply I'd like hear administrators first. The LOCAL Windows Installation: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Windows fully installed workstation hard drive (assuming resources available). From network administrator's implementation, he/she would install windows disks network drive using SETUP/A. Then install windows per/machine bases running SETUP network install complete system local drives. In way, drivers available SETUP procedure w/o need change disks. Advantages: - Reduce Traffic - Running Windows locally reduces network traffic due local access main Windows files. - Network independence - If network fails (and one point another), local installation would allow users keep producing reduce cost down-time. - Faster Windows - Theoretically, Windows run faster local hard drive network. This may hard point prove network optical backbone and/or network drives significantly faster access local ones. - A user traveling machine machine need worry varying setups (monochrome, color, types mouse, etc...) since Windows installation assigned Workstation. Disadvantages: - Cost - Installing Windows locally requires significant amount disk space. Workstations must purchased hard disk increase cost workstation 10 30 percent. - Administration - Local windows installations difficult administer. New drivers peripherals constantly made available, would individually installed workstation. - Security - Users access erase corrupt system files simple ignorance. This could result quite headache administrators may constantly repair damaged installations. - Backup - We know problems backing local hard disks. The backup sets (if done via centralized tape system) get large quickly. Backup individually (to floppy) may happen all. This may eliminated assumed local hard disks contain replaceable applications *not* user data. The SHARED Windows Installation ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Windows fully installed network disk via SETUP/A procedure described above. Users (or administrators) install minimal set files individual ""user"" directories. These directories may local hard disk perhaps network ""home"" directory. The bulk Windows system files maintained network single directory (some 400+ files) accessed (shared) as-needed users throughout Windows session. The user's files consist small set files user updated his/her Windows session. These include group files, .INI files regularly updated files. Advantages: - A single location files makes updates drives easy. As updated driver becomes available, needs installed single directory users able take advantage it. - Assuming users' files maintained network (home) directories, administrator easily edit .INI file as-needed correct problems may arise. This includes WIN.INI SYSTEM.INI. - Backup pertinent files done easily. Even users' files local hard disk, bulk Windows system backed driver updates. Disadvantages: - Network traffic - since Windows files shared network directory, traffic network become problem effect speed Windows. - If network crashes, production comes stop since Window's reliant upon network files. Loss data usually occurs well since users working Windows time crash usually able save work. - Although minimal, disk space still consideration. If users' files maintained network, large number users cause significant utilization disk space due personal Windows files alone. - Users cannot easily move machine machine unless workstation hardware similar. This due Windows installation tied particular username (in case Network user files). The Discussion ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I would like know, administrators large Windows userbase, prefer setting Windows. Personally, I setup numerous installations using SHARED setup. All Windows application files network little utilization local hard disks. In fact, I sold network fact company would longer need purchase hard disks workstations thus save much money. I would also like see recommendations applications. Should apps Word and/or Excel installed locally regardless Windows installed? Again, I keep files network easy backup administration ""putting eggs one basket""; network crashes, work comes halt.",1

"Thanks people recommended Workspace managers Windows 3.1. I found 3 shareware Workspace Managers, Australia's MS-WINDOWS archive (monu6.cc.monash.edu.au), mirrors sites U.S. The three I found were: 1. WORKSPACES 1.10 (wspace.zip) This smallest simplest workspace managers I found. It easy use. It displays small window, containing 6 buttons, plus extra button configuration purposes. One annoying feature title window first presented run - must press key (not mouse button!) thing go away. Also, would nice ""ALWAYS ON TOP"" setting little window containing workspace buttons. Maybe user-specified strings buttons instead numbers one six might nice feature. The simplicity ease use workspace manager makes attractive package. 2. WORKSHIFT 1.6 (wrksft16.zip) While workspace manager offered features WORKSPACES 1.10 lacked, quite time consuming set things up. With WORKSPACES 1.10, first workspace initially empty. With WORKSHIFT 1.6, need take ""snapshots"" want workspaces look like - i.e. applications contain. Also, main window quite large, allow small view workspace. With WORKSPACES 1.10, facility viewing workspace without switching it. WORKSHIFT 1.6 provides viewing functionality quite useful. 3. BIGDESK 2.30 BACKMENU (backdesk.zip) This interesting package, contains goodies well workspace manager. Other goodies include ""Backmenu"", provides pop-up root menu press certain mouse button - like X-Windows. The menu totally configurable, offering unlimited depth cascading menus, provides quite handy access applications. You could say menu-based alternative program manager. Also bundled ""backdesk.zip"" program called ""WRUN"", allows run windows applications DOS shell WINDOWS instead using File Manager run applications. The actual workspace manager called BIGDESK 2.30. BIGDESK works quite differently two workspace managers doesn't provide certain number disjoint separate workspaces. In fact, basically enlarges desktop configurable amount, choose region desktop want screen focus on. This means windows overlapping different viewing regions, unlike first two workspace managers workspace isolated one. The BIGDESK control window allows move windows around enlarged desktop. Basically control window provides small scale view viewing area actual computer screen provides large scale blow-up particular section.",1

In mid-late 80's, MS's point view OS/2 going take world DOS would phased out. As such, resources DOS (and windows, matter) development mostly redirected OS/2. The theory keep enough resources DOS support people started using OS/2, utilities DOS fell wayside. Then Windows 3.0 hit market, OS/2 flopped (1.x, least...2.x seems little better, future still cloudy), people either stayed DOS (3.x 4.x) apps moved Windows.

"OK, discussion observed playback speeds QuickTime, effects scaling on, I thought I'd tests. First all, I felt original speed test perhaps less realistic.

I pulled copy ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" I recorded TV back. About fifteen minutes movie, there's sequence Earth shuttle approaching space station. Specifically, I digitized portion 30 seconds' duration, zooming rotating space station. I figured would give reasonable amount movement frames. To increase differences frames, I digitized 5 frames per second, give total 171 frames. I captured raw footage resolution 384*288 pixels Spigot card Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution PAL source). I imported Premiere put Compact Video compressor, keeping 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions movie: one scaled 320*240 resolution, 160*120 resolution. I used default ""2.00"" quality setting Premiere 2.0.1, specified key frame every ten frames. I ran 320*240 movie ""Raw Speed Test"" program I used results I'd reporting earlier. Result: playback rate 45 frames per second. That's right, I getting much higher result first short test movie. Just fun, I copied 320*240 movie external hard disk (a Quantum LP105S), ran there.

"I happy announce first public release bit program, INTERACTIVE, FULL COLOR image viewer editor based SGI GL. Besides typical touchup tasks, crop, rotate, smooth, etc, bit offers unique features available similar programs, text vector support separation text image. The following relevant sections man page. ----------------------------------------------------------------- Pre-Release May, 1993 BIT(1L) NAME bit - Bitmap Image Touchup SGI Workstations DESCRIPTION bit interactive full color image viewer editor based Silicon Graphics GL. As full color program, bit handles images 24bits color index natural efficient manner. As image viewer, bit allows list images displayed original type (24bits color index) order many built-in styles display. You walk list using mouse keyboard, let bit walk (The SlideShow). With pan zoom features, large images viewed full without limited window screen size. As image editor, bit performs large number image editing processing tasks accurately efficiently. It keeps information loss stage editing process absolute minimum performing subpixel sampling automatically conserving input image type whenever possible avoid unnecessary promotion and/or quantization input images. You also cut piece image paste another. In addition, arbitrarily colored sized text simple geometric figures rendered top image annotation option make part bitmap output separately take advantage higher printer resolutions (e.g. PostScript). Bit also used graphical user interface many existing image processing programs defining external bindings essence turn command line oriented programs bit subfunctions accessed press button, best all, processed image read back displayed immediately. Convolution using exter- nally defined matrices arbitrary order performed dynamically giving great flexibility processing image. FEATURES Bit performs image manipulations interactively continuous progress report, processing complete, processed image displayed. Current features include Rotates image arbitrary angle option anti-aliasing filling ""rotated out"" region arbitrary color. Scales image arbitrary factors x- and/or y-directions option subpixel sampling. Renders text arbitrary color, size orientation top image option rendering directly raster saving text raster separately, PostScript file, take advantage higher printer resolution. Besides normal text strings, many predefined special symbols input conveniently TeX(1), e.g., $\alpha$\small$\beta$ produces Greek alphabet alpha followed slightly smaller Greek alphabet beta. Presents graphically histogram image. Performs arbitrary 1-to-1 pixel transformation. The transformation function specified interactively arbitrary forms. Further, transformation applied RGB channels separately simultaneously entire image portion it. Many difficult tasks, thresholding, accomplished rather easily 1-to-1 transformation combination avai- lability graphical histograms image. Places simple geometric figures (SGFs), e.g., arrows, circles, trian- gles etc., arbitrary color, size orientation image arbitrary locations addressed either absolute pixels user definable coordinate system units, option rendering directly raster save sgfs raster separately (e.g, PostScript file). All SGFs scaled x- y-directions independently simultaneously (this get ellipse circle). Performs edge detection. In combination image histograms 1- to-1 transformation, accurate result obtained. Performs histogram equalization. Performs convolution externally defined (square) matrices arbitrary order. Crops rectangular portion image. Cuts pastes across images. Magnifies portion image amount. Displays list images sequence user specifiable pause interval images.

If don't get reply, server may misreading return address; add line ""path myname@mysite"" specify correct e-mail address reply to. ---------- [1] What JPEG? JPEG (pronounced ""jay-peg"") standardized image compression mechanism. JPEG stands Joint Photographic Experts Group, original name committee wrote standard. JPEG designed compressing either full-color gray-scale digital images ""natural"", real-world scenes. It work well non-realistic images, cartoons line drawings. JPEG handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, handle motion picture compression. Standards compressing types images worked committees, named JBIG MPEG respectively. JPEG ""lossy"", meaning image get decompression isn't quite identical originally put in. The algorithm achieves much compression exploiting known limitations human eye, notably fact small color details aren't perceived well small details light-and-dark. Thus, JPEG intended compressing images looked humans. If plan machine-analyze images, small errors introduced JPEG may problem you, even invisible eye. A useful property JPEG degree lossiness varied adjusting compression parameters. This means image maker trade file size output image quality. You make *extremely* small files don't mind poor quality; useful indexing image archives, making thumbnail views icons, etc. etc. Conversely, aren't happy output quality default compression setting, jack quality satisfied, accept lesser compression. [2] Why use JPEG? There two good reasons: make image files smaller, store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead 8-bit-per-pixel data. Making image files smaller big win transmitting files across networks archiving libraries images. Being able compress 2 Mbyte full-color file 100 Kbytes makes big difference disk space transmission time! (If comparing GIF JPEG, size ratio like four one. More details below.) If viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll convert JPEG format viewing manipulating images. Even JPEG-capable viewer, takes longer decode view JPEG image view image simpler format (GIF, instance). Thus, using JPEG essentially time/space tradeoff: give time order store transmit image cheaply. It's worth noting network phone transmission involved, time savings transferring shorter file much greater extra time decompress file. I'll let arithmetic yourself. The reason JPEG gradually replace GIF standard Usenet posting format JPEG store full color information: 24 bits/pixel (16 million colors) instead 8 less (256 fewer colors). If 8-bit display hardware may seem like much advantage you. Within couple years, though, 8-bit GIF look obsolete black-and-white MacPaint format today. Furthermore, reasons detailed section 7, JPEG far useful GIF exchanging images among people widely varying color display hardware. Hence JPEG considerably appropriate GIF use Usenet posting standard. [3] When I use JPEG, I stick GIF? JPEG *not* going displace GIF entirely; types images, GIF superior image quality, file size, both. One first things learn JPEG kinds images apply to. As rule thumb, JPEG superior GIF storing full-color gray-scale images ""realistic"" scenes; means scanned photographs similar material. JPEG superior even don't 24-bit display hardware, LOT superior do. (See section 7 details.) GIF significantly better images distinct colors, cartoons line drawings. In particular, large areas pixels *exactly* color compressed efficiently indeed GIF. JPEG can't squeeze files much GIF without introducing visible defects. This sort image best kept GIF form. (In particular, single-color borders quite cheap GIF files, avoided JPEG files.) JPEG also hard time sharp edges: row pure-black pixels adjacent row pure-white pixels, example. Sharp edges tend come blurred unless use high quality setting. Again, sort thing found scanned photographs, shows fairly often GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc. The blurriness particularly objectionable text that's pixels high. If GIF lot small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it. Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, instance) usually fall scanned images cartoons terms complexity. The complex subtly rendered image, likely JPEG well it. The goes semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings such). Plain black-and-white (two level) images never converted JPEG. You need least 16 gray levels JPEG useful gray-scale images. It also noted GIF lossless gray-scale images 256 levels, JPEG not. If existing library GIF images, may wonder whether convert JPEG. You lose little image quality do. (Section 7, argues JPEG image quality superior GIF, applies formats start full-color original. If start GIF, you've already irretrievably lost great deal information; JPEG make things worse.) However, disk space savings may justify converting anyway. This decision you'll make yourself. If convert GIF library JPEG, see section 14 hints. Be prepared leave images GIF format, since GIFs convert well. [4] How well JPEG compress images? Pretty darn well. Here sample file sizes image I handy, 727x525 full-color image ship harbor. The first three files comparison purposes; rest created free JPEG software described section 6B. File Size bytes Comments ship.ppm 1145040 Original file PPM format (no compression; 24 bits 3 bytes per pixel, plus bytes overhead) ship.ppm.Z 963829 PPM file passed Unix compress compress doesn't accomplish lot, you'll note. Other text-oriented compressors give similar results. ship.gif 240438 Converted GIF ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif Most savings result losing color info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, 24. (See sec. 7.) ship.jpg95 155622 cjpeg -Q 95 (highest useful quality setting) This indistinguishable 24-bit original, least nonprofessional eyeballs. ship.jpg75 58009 cjpeg -Q 75 (default setting) You look mighty darn close distinguish original, even on-screen once. ship.jpg50 38406 cjpeg -Q 50 This slight defects; know look for, could tell it's JPEGed without seeing original. Still good image quality many recent postings Usenet pictures groups. ship.jpg25 25192 cjpeg -Q 25 JPEG's characteristic ""blockiness"" becomes apparent setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some). Still, I've seen plenty Usenet postings poorer image quality this. ship.jpg5o 6587 cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize (-optimize cuts table overhead) Blocky, perfectly satisfactory preview indexing purposes. Note file TINY: compression ratio original 173:1 In case JPEG make file that's factor four five smaller GIF comparable quality (the -Q 75 file every bit good GIF, better full-color display). This seems typical ratio real-world scenes. [5] What good ""quality"" settings JPEG? Most JPEG compressors let pick file size vs. image quality tradeoff selecting quality setting. There seems widespread confusion meaning settings. ""Quality 95"" NOT mean ""keep 95% information"", claimed. The quality scale purely arbitrary; it's percentage anything. The name game using JPEG pick lowest quality setting (smallest file size) decompresses image indistinguishable original. This setting vary one image another one observer another, rules thumb. The default quality setting (-Q 75) often best choice. This setting lowest go without expecting see defects typical image. Try -Q 75 first; see defects, go up. Except experimental purposes, never go -Q 95; saying -Q 100 produce file two three times large -Q 95, hardly better quality. If image less perfect quality begin with, might able go -Q 50 without objectionable degradation. On hand, might need go HIGHER quality setting avoid degradation. The second case seems apply much time converting GIFs JPEG. The default -Q 75 right compressing 24-bit images, -Q 85 95 usually better converting GIFs (see section 14 info). If want small file (say preview indexing purposes) prepared tolerate large defects, -Q setting range 5 10 right. -Q 2 may amusing ""op art"". (Note: quality settings discussed article apply free JPEG software described section 6B, many programs based it. Other JPEG implementations, Image Alchemy, may use completely different quality scale. Some programs don't even provide numeric scale, ""high""/""medium""/""low""-style choices.) [6] Where I get JPEG software? Most programs described section available FTP. If don't know use FTP, see FAQ article ""How find sources"". (If don't direct access FTP, read ftpmail servers article.) That article appears regularly news.answers, get sending e-mail mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu ""send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources"" body.

If copy couple months old, get latest JPEG FAQ news.answers archive. [6A] If looking ""canned"" software, viewers, etc: The first part list system-specific programs run one kind system. If don't see want machine, check portable JPEG software described end list. Note list concentrates free shareware programs obtain Internet; commercial programs listed too. X Windows: XV (shareware, $25) excellent viewer JPEG, GIF, many image formats. It also format conversion simple image manipulations. It's available FTP export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12), file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z. Version 3.00 major upgrade support 24-bit displays many improvements; however, brand new still bugs lurking. If prefer bleeding edge, stick version 2.21, also available export. Note version 2.21 good choice 24-bit display (you'll get 8-bit color), converting 24-bit images JPEG. But 2.21 works fine converting GIF 8-bit images JPEG. CAUTION: glitch version 2.21: sure check ""save normal size"" checkbox saving JPEG file, file blurry. Another good choice X Windows John Cristy's free ImageMagick package, also available export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z. This package handles many image processing conversion tasks. The ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; colormapped displays, better (though slower) color quantization XV basic free JPEG software. Both large, complex packages. If want simple image viewer, try xloadimage xli. xloadimage supports JPEG latest release, 3.03. xloadimage free available export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z. xli variant version xloadimage, said fans somewhat faster robust original. (The current xli indeed faster robust current xloadimage, least respect JPEG files, IJG v4 decoder xloadimage 3.03 using hacked-over v1. The next xloadimage release fix this.) xli also free available export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z. Both programs said right thing 24-bit displays. MS-DOS: This covers plain DOS; Windows OS/2 programs, see next headings. One good choice Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, views JPEG GIF files. The current version, 2.5, available FTP sunee.uwaterloo.ca (129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip. This good basic viewer works either 286 386/486 machines. The user interface flashy, it's functional. Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview. The current version, 1.2, available Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip. Hiview requires 386 better CPU VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 386MAX work; Windows OS/2 not). Hiview currently fastest viewer images bigger screen. For larger images, scales image fit screen (rather using panning/scrolling viewers do). You may may prefer approach, there's denying slows loading large images considerably. Note: installation bit tricky; read directions carefully! A shareware alternative ColorView DOS ($30). This easier install either two freeware alternatives. Its user interface also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find harder use --- keystrokes, inconsistent behavior. It faster DVPEG little slower Hiview, least hardware. (For images larger screen size, DVPEG ColorView seem speed, faster Hiview.) The current version 2.1, available Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip. Requires VESA graphics driver; don't one, look vesadrv2.zip vesa-tsr.zip directory. (Many recent PCs built-in VESA driver, don't try load VESA driver unless ColorView complains driver missing.) A second shareware alternative Fullview, kicking around net while, I don't know stable archive location it. The current (rather old) version inferior viewers anyway. The author tells new version Fullview shortly submitted Simtel20 archives time. The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG latest revision, 8.60a. However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't good: it's slow (about half speed viewers) image quality poor except hi-color displays. Too bad ... it'd nice see good JPEG capability CSHOW. Shareware, $25. Available Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip. Due remarkable variety PC graphics hardware, one viewers might work particular machine. If can't get *any* work, you'll need use one following conversion programs convert JPEG GIF, view favorite GIF viewer. (If hi-color hardware, don't use GIF intermediate format; try find TARGA-capable viewer instead. VPIC5.0 reputed right thing hi-color displays.) The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters FTPable Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or jpeg4386.zip 386 extended memory).

These slow limited conversion GIF format; particular, can't get 24-bit color output JPEG. The major advantage tools read write HSI's proprietary JPEG format well Usenet-standard JFIF format. Since HSI-format files rather widespread BBSes, useful capability. Version 2.0 tools free (prior versions shareware). Get Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip. NOTE: use HSI format files posted Internet, since readable non-PC platforms. Handmade Software also shareware image conversion manipulation package, Image Alchemy. This translate JPEG files (both JFIF HSI formats) many image formats. It also display images. A demo version Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 available Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip. NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site PC-related programs Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20). Simtel20 runs non-Unix system weird directory names; document refers directory (eg) ""msdos/graphics"" Simtel20, really means ""pd1:<msdos.graphics>"". If physically MILnet, expect rather slow FTP transfer rates Simtel20. There several Internet sites maintain copies (mirrors) Simtel20 archives; FTP users go one mirror sites instead. A popular USA mirror site oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), keeps Simtel20 files (eg) ""/pub/msdos/graphics"". If FTP capability, retrieve files Simtel20 e-mail; see informational postings comp.archives.msdos.announce find how. If outside USA, consult newsgroup learn nearest Simtel20 mirror is. Microsoft Windows: There several Windows programs capable displaying JPEG images. (Windows viewers generally slower DOS viewers hardware, due Windows' system overhead. Note run DOS conversion programs described inside Windows DOS window.) The newest entry WinECJ, free EXTREMELY fast. Version 1.0 available ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip. Requires Windows 3.1 256-or-more-colors mode. This no-frills viewer bad habit hogging machine completely decodes; image quality noticeably worse viewers. But it's fast you'll use anyway, least previewing... JView freeware, fairly fast, good on-line help, write decompressed image Windows BMP format; can't create new JPEG files, doesn't view GIFs. JView also lacks useful features shareware viewers (such brightness adjustment), it's excellent basic viewer. The current version, 0.9, available ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip. (Mirrors archive found Internet sites, including wuarchive.wustl.edu.) WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, BMP image files; write formats too, used converter. It nifty features including color-balance adjustment slideshow. The current version 2.1, available Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip. (This slow 286-compatible version; register, you'll get 386-only version, roughly 25% faster.) ColorView another shareware entry ($30). This early promising contender, updated time, point real advantages WinJPEG. If want try anyway, current version 0.97, available ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip. (I understand new version appearing authors finished ColorView DOS.) DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works Windows, full-screen mode, window. OS/2: The following files available hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151). Note: check /pub/uploads recent versions --- hobbes moderator fast moving uploads permanent directories. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip 32-bit version free IJG conversion programs, version 4. /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip 16-bit version same, OS/2 1.x. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing PM graphical interface. Strong conversion functions, viewing bit weaker. Shareware, $15. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port WinJPEG, popular viewer Windows (see description Windows section). Shareware, $20. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP/Targa/PCX viewer. GIF viewing fast, JPEG viewing roughly speed two programs. Has image manipulation slideshow functions. Shareware, $20. Macintosh: Most Mac JPEG programs rely Apple's JPEG implementation, part QuickTime system extension; need QuickTime installed. To use QuickTime, need 68020 better CPU need running System 6.0.7 later. (If you're running System 6, must also install 32-bit QuickDraw extension; built-in System 7.) You get QuickTime FTP ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx. (As 11/92, file contains QuickTime 1.5, better QT 1.0 several ways. With respect JPEG, marginally faster considerably less prone crash fed corrupt JPEG file. However, applications seem compatibility problems QT 1.5.) Mac users keep mind QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format. (See section 10 details.) If post images Usenet, make sure JFIF format. Most programs mentioned generate either format. The first choice probably JPEGView, free program viewing images JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, GIF format. It also convert two JPEG formats. The current version, 2.0, big improvement prior versions. Get sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx. Requires System 7 QuickTime. On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces best color image quality currently available Mac JPEG viewers. JPEGView view large images much less memory Mac viewers; fact, it's one deal JPEG images much 640x480 pixels typical 4MB Mac. Given large image, JPEGView automatically scales fit screen, rather presenting scroll bars like viewers. (You zoom desired portion, though.) Some people like behavior, don't. Overall, JPEGView's user interface well thought out. GIFConverter, shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF PICT/JPEG, well GIF several image formats. The latest version 2.3.2. Get sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx. Requires System 6.0.5 later. GIFConverter better JPEGView plain JPEG/GIF viewer, much extensive image manipulation format conversion capabilities, may find worth shareware fee lot playing around images. Also, newest version GIFConverter load save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, best bet machine old run QuickTime. (But it's faster QuickTime.) Note: If GIFConverter runs memory trying load large JPEG, try converting file GIF JPEG Convert, viewing GIF version. JPEG Convert, Mac version free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, available sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx. This run Mac, file conversion, viewing. You use conjunction GIF viewer. Previous versions FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, JPEG<=>GIF converter based old version IJG code. If using program, definitely replace JPEG Convert. Apple's free program PictPixie view images JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, GIF format, convert formats. You get PictPixie ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx. Requires QuickTime. PictPixie intended developer's tool, it's really best choice unless like fool around QuickTime. Some drawbacks requires lots memory, produces relatively poor color image quality anything less 24-bit display, relatively unfriendly user interface. Worse, PictPixie unsupported program, meaning minor bugs Apple intend fix. (There old version PictPixie, called PICTCompressor, floating around net. If trash it, it's even buggier. Also, QuickTime Starter Kit includes much cleaned-up descendant PictPixie called Picture Compressor. Note Picture Compressor NOT free may distributed net.) Storm Technology's Picture Decompress free JPEG viewer/converter. This rather old program inferior programs many ways, run without System 7 QuickTime, may forced use older systems. (It need 32-bit QuickDraw, really old machines can't use it.) You get sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx. You must set file type downloaded image file 'JPEG' allow Picture Decompress open it. If machine old run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus instance), GIFConverter choice single-program JPEG viewing. If don't want pay GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert free GIF viewer. More commercial Mac applications supporting JPEG, although deal Usenet-standard JFIF format. Adobe Photoshop, version 2.0.1 later, read write JFIF-format JPEG files (use JPEG plug-in Acquire menu). You must set file type downloaded JPEG file 'JPEG' allow Photoshop recognize it. Amiga: (Most programs listed section stored AmiNet archive amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80). There many mirror sites archive try use closest one. In USA, good choice wuarchive.wustl.edu; look /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...) HamLab Plus excellent JPEG viewer/converter, well general image manipulation tool. It's cheap (shareware, $20) read several formats besides JPEG. The current version 2.0.8. A demo version available amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha. The demo version crop images larger 512x512, otherwise fully functional. Rend24 (shareware, $30) image renderer display JPEG, ILBM, GIF images. The program used create animations, even capturing frames on-the-fly rendering packages like Lightwave. The current version 1.05, available amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha. (Note: although directory supposedly AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, program also run AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 2.1.) Viewtek free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer. The current version 1.04, available amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha. If you're willing spend real money, several commercial packages support JPEG. Two written Thomas Krehbiel, author Rend24 Viewtek. These CineMorph, standalone image morphing package, ImageFX, impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting, effects prepress package also includes CineMorph. Both distributed Great Valley Products. Art Department Professional (ADPro), ASDG Inc, widely used commercial image manipulation software Amigas. ImageMaster, Black Belt Systems, another well-regarded commercial graphics package JPEG support. The free IJG JPEG software available compiled Amigas amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) directory amiga/gfx/conv, file AmigaJPEGV4.lha. These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats. The Amiga world heavily infested quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many based ancient beta-test version free IJG JPEG software (thanks certain magazine published disk-of-the-month, without much notifying authors). Among ""AugJPEG"", ""NewAmyJPEG"", ""VJPEG"", probably others I even heard of. In opinion, anything older IJG version 3 (March 1992) worth disk space it's stored on; program, trash get something newer. Atari ST: The free IJG JPEG software available compiled Atari ST, TT, etc, atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo. These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats. For monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, manages achieve four-level grayscale effect flickering. Version 4.1 reads JPEG files. Available atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo. I heard free shareware JPEG-capable viewers Ataris, surely must now? Pointers appreciated. Acorn Archimedes: !ChangeFSI, supplied RISC OS 3 version 3.10, convert view JPEG JFIF format. Provision also made convert images JPEG, although must done CLI rather double-clicking. Recent versions (since 7.11) shareware program Translator handle JPEG, along 30 image formats. While older versions found Archimedes bboards, current version available registering author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede, The Netherlands. Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 10 pounds). There's also commercial product called !JPEG provides JPEG read/write functionality direct JPEG viewing, well host image format conversion processing options. This expensive necessarily better programs. Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST, Cambridge, UK. Tel: 0223 841099. NeXT: ImageViewer PD utility displays images format conversions. The current version reads JPEG write it. ImageViewer available standard NeXT archives sonata.cc.purdue.edu cs.orst.edu, somewhere /pub/next (both currently re-organized, it's hard point specific sub-directories). Note older version floating around support JPEG. Portable software almost system: If none fits situation, obtain compile free JPEG conversion software described 6B. You'll also need viewer program. If display 8 bits less, GIF viewer fine; display color capability, try find viewer read Targa PPM 24-bit image files. There numerous commercial JPEG offerings, popping every day. I recommend spend money one unless find available free shareware software vastly slow. In case, purchase hardware-assisted product. Ask pointed questions whether product complies final JPEG standard whether handle JFIF file format; many earliest commercial releases never compatible anyone else's files. [6B] If looking source code work with: Free, portable C code JPEG compression available Independent JPEG Group, I lead. A package containing source code, documentation, small test files available several places. The ""official"" archive site source code ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9 192.48.96.9). Look directory /graphics/jpeg; current release jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z. (This compressed TAR file; don't forget retrieve binary mode.) You retrieve file FTP UUCP. If PC don't know cope .tar.Z format, may prefer ZIP format, find Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip. This file also available CompuServe, GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, jpsrc4.zip. If FTP access, retrieve source nearest comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared issues 55-72 volume 34. (If don't know retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see FAQ article ""How find sources"", referred top section 6.) The free JPEG code provides conversion JPEG ""JFIF"" format image files GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, Truevision Targa file formats. The core compression decompression modules easily reused programs, image viewers. The package highly portable; tested many machines ranging PCs Crays. We released software noncommercial commercial use. Companies welcome use basis JPEG-related products. We ask royalty, although ask acknowledgement product literature (see README file distribution details). We hope make software industrial-quality --- although, anything that's free, offer warranty accept liability. The Independent JPEG Group volunteer organization; you'd like contribute improving software, welcome join. [7] What's hoopla color quantization? Most people don't full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware. Typical display hardware stores 8 fewer bits per pixel, display 256 fewer distinct colors time. To display full-color image, computer must map image appropriate set representative colors. This process called ""color quantization"". (This something misnomer, ""color selection"" would better term. We're stuck standard usage though.) Clearly, color quantization lossy process. It turns images, details color quantization algorithm MUCH impact final image quality errors introduced JPEG (except lowest JPEG quality settings). Since JPEG full-color format, converting color JPEG image display 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization. This true *all* color JPEGs: even feed 256-or-less-color GIF JPEG, comes decompressor *not* 256 colors, thousands colors. This happens JPEG's lossiness affects pixel little differently, two pixels started identical colors probably come slightly different colors. Each original color gets ""smeared"" group nearby colors. Therefore quantization always required display color JPEG colormapped display, regardless image source. The way avoid quantization ask gray-scale output. (Incidentally, effect it's nearly meaningless talk number colors used JPEG image. Even attempted count number distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give different results roundoff error differences. I occasionally see posted images described ""256-color JPEG"". This tells poster (a) hasn't read FAQ (b) probably converted JPEG GIF. JPEGs classified color gray-scale (just like photographs), number colors isn't useful concept JPEG.) On hand, GIF image definition already quantized 256 fewer colors. (A GIF *does* definite number colors palette, format doesn't allow 256 palette entries.) For purposes Usenet picture distribution, GIF advantage sender precomputes color quantization, recipients don't to. This also *disadvantage* GIF: you're stuck sender's quantization. If sender quantized different number colors display, re-quantize, resulting much poorer image quality quantized full-color image. Furthermore, sender didn't use high-quality color quantization algorithm, you're luck. For reason, JPEG offers promise significantly better image quality users whose machines don't match sender's display hardware. JPEG's full color image quantized precisely match user's display hardware. Furthermore, able take advantage future improvements quantization algorithms (there lot active research area), purchase better display hardware, get better view JPEG images already have. With GIF, you're stuck forevermore sent. It's also worth mentioning many GIF-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines. If view 256-color GIF 16-color EGA display, example, probably getting much worse image need to. This partly inevitable consequence two color quantizations (one create GIF, one display it), often it's also due sloppiness. JPEG conversion programs forced use high quality quantizers order get acceptable results all, normal use quantize directly number colors displayed. Thus, JPEG likely provide better results average GIF program low-color-resolution displays well high-resolution ones! Finally, ever-growing number people better-than-8-bit display hardware already: 15-bit ""hi-color"" PC displays, true 24-bit displays workstations Macintoshes, etc. For people, GIF already obsolete, cannot represent image full capabilities display. JPEG images drive displays much effectively. Thus, JPEG all-around better choice GIF representing images machine-independent fashion. [8] How JPEG work? The buzz-words know chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine transforms, coefficient quantization, Huffman arithmetic entropy coding. This article's long enough already, I'm going say here. For technical information, see comp.compression FAQ. This available news.answers archive rtfm.mit.edu, files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3]. If need help using news.answers archive, see top article. [9] What lossless JPEG? There's great deal confusion subject. The JPEG committee define truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one guarantees final output bit-for-bit identical original input. However, lossless mode almost nothing common regular, lossy JPEG algorithm, offers much less compression. At present, implementations lossless JPEG exist, commercial. Saying ""-Q 100"" free JPEG software DOES NOT get lossless image. What get rid deliberate information loss coefficient quantization step. There still good deal information loss color subsampling step. (With V4 free JPEG code, also say ""-sample 1x1"" turn subsampling. Keep mind many commercial JPEG implementations cannot cope resulting file.) Even quantization subsampling turned off, regular JPEG algorithm lossless, subject roundoff errors various calculations. The maximum error counts one pixel value; it's highly unlikely could perceived human eye, might concern machine processing image. At minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files perhaps half size uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image. True lossless JPEG provides roughly amount compression, guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy. If application requiring lossless storage images less 6 bits per pixel (per color component), may want look JBIG bilevel image compression standard. This performs better JPEG lossless images. JPEG lossless superior JBIG images 6 bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG public domain (at least Huffman back end), JBIG techniques heavily covered patents. [10] Why argument file formats? Strictly speaking, JPEG refers family compression algorithms; *not* refer specific image file format. The JPEG committee prevented defining file format turf wars within international standards organizations. Since can't actually exchange images anyone else unless agree common file format, leaves us problem. In absence official standards, number JPEG program writers gone ""do thing"", result programs aren't compatible anybody else's. The closest thing de-facto standard JPEG format work that's coordinated people C-Cube Microsystems. They defined two JPEG-based file formats: * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), ""low-end"" format transports pixels much else. * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, extension Aldus TIFF format. TIFF ""high-end"" format let record everything ever wanted know image, lot besides :-). TIFF lot complex JFIF, may well prove less transportable, different vendors historically implemented slightly different incompatible subsets TIFF. It's likely adding JPEG mix anything improve situation. Both formats developed input major vendors JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely future commercial products adhere one standards. I believe Usenet adopt JFIF replacement GIF picture postings. JFIF simpler TIFF available now; TIFF 6.0 spec recently officially adopted, still unusably vague crucial details. Even TIFF/JPEG well defined, JFIF format likely widely supported ""lowest common denominator""; TIFF/JPEG files may never transportable. A particular case people may interested Apple's QuickTime software Macintosh. QuickTime uses JFIF-compatible format wrapped inside Mac-specific PICT structure. Conversion JFIF QuickTime JPEG pretty straightforward, several Mac programs available (see Mac portion section 6A). If editor handles binary files, strip QuickTime JPEG PICT JFIF hand; see section 11 details. Another particular case Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF Image Alchemy). These programs capable reading writing JFIF format. By default, though, write proprietary format developed HSI. This format NOT readable non-HSI programs used Usenet postings. Use -j switch get JFIF output. (This applies old versions programs; current releases emit JFIF format default. You still careful post HSI-format files, unless want get flamed people non-PC platforms.) [11] How I recognize file format I have, I it? If alleged JPEG file software won't read, it's likely HSI format proprietary JPEG-based format. You tell inspecting first bytes file: 1. A JFIF-standard file start characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0, followed two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed 'JFIF'. 2. If see FF D8 start, rest it, may ""raw JPEG"" file. This probably decodable as-is JFIF software --- it's worth try, anyway. 3. HSI files start 'hsi1'. You're luck unless HSI software. Portions file may look like plain JPEG data, won't decompress properly non-HSI programs. 4. A Macintosh PICT file, JPEG-compressed, couple hundred bytes header followed JFIF header (scan 'JFIF'). Strip everything FF D8 able read it. 5. Anything else: it's proprietary format, JPEG all. If lucky, file may consist header raw JPEG data stream. If identify start JPEG data stream (look FF D8), try stripping everything that. In uuencoded Usenet postings, characteristic JFIF pattern ""begin"" line M_]C_X ... whereas uuencoded HSI files start ""begin"" line M:'-I ... If learn check former, save trouble downloading non-JFIF files. [12] What arithmetic coding? The JPEG spec defines two different ""back end"" modules final output compressed data: either Huffman coding arithmetic coding allowed. The choice impact image quality, arithmetic coding usually produces smaller compressed file. On typical images, arithmetic coding produces file 5 10 percent smaller Huffman coding. (All file-size numbers previously cited Huffman coding.) Unfortunately, particular variant arithmetic coding specified JPEG standard subject patents owned IBM, AT&T, Mitsubishi. Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless obtain licenses companies. (The ""fair use"" doctrine allows people implement test algorithm, actually storing images dubious best.) At least short run, I recommend people worry arithmetic coding; space savings isn't great enough justify potential legal hassles. In particular, arithmetic coding *should not* used images exchanged Usenet. There small chance legal situation may change future. Stay tuned details. [13] Does loss accumulate repeated compression/decompression? It would nice if, compressed image JPEG, could decompress it, manipulate (crop border, say), recompress without image degradation beyond lost initially. Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE. In general, recompressing altered image loses information, though usually much lost first time around. The next best thing would decompress image recompress *without changing it* loss, i.e., get identical JPEG file. Even true; least, current free JPEG software. It's essentially problem accumulation roundoff error. If repeatedly compress decompress, image eventually degrade see visible changes first-generation output. (It usually takes many cycles get visible change.) One things to-do list see accumulation error avoided limited, I optimistic it. In case, could possibly guaranteed would compressing unmodified full-color output djpeg, original quality setting, would introduce loss. Even simple changes cropping border could cause roundoff-error degradation. (If you're wondering why, it's pixel-block boundaries move. If cropped multiples 16 pixels, might safe, that's mighty limited capability!) The bottom line JPEG useful format archival storage transmission images, don't want use intermediate format sequences image manipulation steps. Use lossless format (PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) working image, JPEG ready file away. Aside avoiding degradation, save lot compression/decompression time way :-). [14] What rules thumb converting GIF images JPEG? As stated earlier, *will* lose amount image information convert existing GIF image JPEG. If obtain original full-color data GIF made from, it's far better make JPEG that. But need save space GIF work from, suggestions getting maximum space savings minimum loss quality. The first rule converting GIF library look JPEG, make sure happy it, throwing away corresponding GIF; give chance re-do conversion higher quality setting necessary. Some GIFs may better left GIFs, explained section 3; particular, cartoon-type GIFs sixteen fewer colors don't convert well. You may find JPEG file reasonable quality *larger* GIF. (So check sizes too.) Experience date suggests large, high-visual-quality GIFs best candidates conversion JPEG. They chew storage offer potential savings, convert JPEG least degradation. Don't waste time converting GIF much 100 Kbytes. Also, don't expect JPEG files converted GIFs small created directly full-color originals. To maintain image quality may let converted files much twice big straight-through JPEG files would (i.e., shoot 1/2 1/3rd size GIF file, 1/4th suggested earlier comparisons). Many people developed odd habit putting large constant-color border around GIF image. While useless, nearly free terms storage cost GIF files. It NOT free JPEG files, sharp border boundary create visible artifacts (""ghost"" edges). Do favor crop border JPEGing. (If X Windows system, XV's manual automatic cropping functions painless way this.) cjpeg's default Q setting 75 appropriate full-color input, GIF inputs, Q settings 85 95 often seem necessary avoid image degradation. (If apply smoothing suggested below, higher Q setting may necessary.) Color GIFs photographs complex artwork usually ""dithered"" fool eye seeing 256 colors GIF actually store. If enlarge image, see adjacent pixels often significantly different colors; normal size eye averages pixels together produce illusion intermediate color value. The trouble dithering that, JPEG, looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise; JPEG can't compress noise well. The resulting JPEG file larger lower image quality would gotten JPEGing original full color image (if it). To get around this, want ""smooth"" GIF image compression. Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating color thought saw anyway, process getting rid rapid color changes give JPEG trouble. Appropriate use smoothing often let avoid using high Q factor, thus reducing size compressed file, still obtaining better-looking output image you'd get without smoothing. With V4 free JPEG software (or products based it), simple smoothing capability built in. Try ""-smooth 10"" converting GIFs. Values 10 25 seem work well high-quality GIFs. Heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors. (If see regular fine-scale patterns GIF image even without enlargement, strong smoothing definitely called for.) Too large smoothing factor blur output image, don't want. If image processing wizard, also smoothing separate filtering program, pnmconvol PBMPLUS package. However, cjpeg's built-in smoother LOT faster pnmconvol... The upshot ""cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10"" probably good starting point converting GIFs. But really care image, you'll want check results maybe try settings. --------------------- For information JPEG general free JPEG software particular, contact Independent JPEG Group jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.",0

"First (this NOT snide response), you're confused issue, stumble lot things well. I suggest weakness reference material. Get ""An Introduction Ray Tracing"" Andrew Glassner good coverage raytracing algorithm. You could also refer 2nd edition Foley Van Dam. On question. The simple answer keep adding contributions clamping maximum intensity. For example, intensity values range 0.0 1.0, keep adding clamp resultant values 1.0 (you might clamp lower bound 0.0 dark bulbs, that's another issue =^). So, get illumination equation like this: I = Lambient + Ldiffuse(light[n]) + Lreflected + Ltransparent The contribution due reflection summed light intensity, light due transparency. Now, slightly less hand-waving illumination equation this: I = KaLa + KdLd(light[n]) + KrLr + KtLt That is, component illumination equation governed material constants Ka, Kd, Kr Kt. So maximum get transparency given object, example, might [0.4, 0.1, 0.5] purple-colored glass object. Hopefully answers question. I'll forward ""illumination equation sermon"" also.",0
"Gawd, I love Windows :-) You'll probably want delete damaged executables reload fresh. Data files examined repaired. You're stupid. Smartdrive caches things, Windows also runs swap file may contain data also. All pretty risky stuff PC environment. A reasonably accurate prediction... Here's brief description DOS stores files: There three pieces file. The directory entry, FAT chain, data area. You think sheet lined notebook paper, sheet graph paper, stack 3X5 cards. The directory entry (notebook paper) holds file name, actual size, first cluster number. It also holds information that's important right now. The File Allocation Table (FAT) chain (graph paper) tells find actual data. Each square graph paper holds number. If number zero, cluster associated box available. If holds ""magic"" number, either last piece file bad (unuseable) spot disk. Any number tells cluster contains next section file. The data area (3X5 cards) actual information stored. The data area organized clusters fixed size; storage doled ""chunks"" one cluster each. (In case, one cluster 2048 bytes.) As cluster filled, another allocated. To read file, first look directory entry get starting cluster number. Now read data cluster. Next, look FAT entry cluster read. This tell cluster number next chunk file. Naturally, numbers usually sequential, jump around even go backwards. Continue reading, one cluster time, walk chain FAT, hit marker says it's last cluster file. CHKDSK DOS utility checks sanity coherence directories FAT bludgeon flaws submission. It doesn't intelligence, double-check anything ""fixes"". Now let's bit post-mortem: All files sizes (according FAT) don't match size reported directory entries. CHKDSK /F alter directory entries match FAT size. (In words, directory entry CVPIC.EXE may say file 64,877 bytes long. But CHKDSK found FAT chain 43 clusters attached it. (My numbers, obviously, made up.)) Disk space found allocated FAT, attached directory entry. CHKDSK /F gives option converting ""lost chains"" files. You examine files (FILE0000.CHK FILE0223.CHK) rename discard them. Or, tell CHKDSK _not_ convert files, clusters simply marked ""available"" FAT. ... These files referencing _same_ data cluster. Obviously, one (at least) must wrong. It's interesting note C:\386SPART.PAR Windows swap file... To fix this, copy cross-linked file new name. This ""fix"" cross-link giving files unique data spaces. Now delete cross-linked files. Examine copies try assemble properly. Good luck. (Hint: ""Missing pieces"" likely found ""lost chains"" top...) Your disk pretty close full. This may actual cause problem; perhaps Windows needed expand swapfile amount exceeded available disk space... In case, short summary something trashed FAT. There utilities mirror FAT help repair damage something like this, run _before_ problem occurs. Sorry. -- ---------------------------------------------------- Gordon S.

Ok It game 3d listed characteristics looking for. I think may left important parameters. The polygons convex. They less N sides. (you drawing meshes walls doors etc.) I believe algorithms get draw convex polygons much efficient draw concave self intersecting polygons. This efficiency largely attributed fact simple convex polygons left right edge scan line. Complex (figure 8 type polygons) bit trickier. The less N sides specification especially small number like 3 4 allow othe optimisations made. Thus high speed game application I think looking code exploits hence limited drawing simple convex polygons. It may general purpose algorithms. If limit 3 four sided simple convex polygons I think might suprised fast c algorithm asm block move fill scan line might actually be.,0

"Intro ACCESS.bus (RE: ACCESS.bus Software Creator's Contest Announcement) WHAT IS ACCESS.bus? ACCESS.bus new open industry standard computer peripheral connectivity. ACCESS.bus serial protocol uses simple, low-cost I2C technology link multiple devices single PC port. Peripheral devices keyboards keypads, locators (Mice, Trackballs, Joysticks), printers, VR gloves, digitizers, sensors, actuators data transmitters others easily daisy chained host PC. Applications CAD/CAM, Data Acquisition, Simulation, Virtual Reality, Multiple-Player/Single PC Games, Education many, many take advantage ACCESS.bus, technology puts Plug Play every PC. The ACCESS.bus offers advantages end-users developers systems peripherals. Multiple devices connect host computer one port. Common communication methods number device types lead simplified hardware software development. As open standard, ACCESS.bus enables cross- platform use device. ACCESS.bus TECHNOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION: ===================================== ACCESS.bus technology open specification, enabling anyone implement host systems peripheral devices without fee royalty. ACCESS.bus bus topology architecture. That is, single host accommodate 125 peripheral devices. ACCESS.bus data rate 100 Kbits/sec. ACCESS.bus Physical Layer ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ACCESS.bus serial bus architecture, based I2C hardware protocol, one data line one clock line. Standard low-cost I2C microcontrollers handle bit-level handshaking, including automatic arbitration clock synchronization. ACCESS.bus Software Protocols ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ The ACCESS.bus communication protocol composed three levels: I2C Protocol, Base Protocol, Application Protocol. I2C PROTOCOL: This simple efficient protocol defines arbitration among contending masters without losing data. I2C provides cooperative synchronization bus partners different clock rates. Bus transactions include addressing, framing bits bytes, byte acknowledgment receiver. BASE PROTOCOL: Establishes asymmetrical interconnect host computer multiple peripherals. The host becomes ACCESS.bus manager. The Base Protocol defines format ACCESS.bus message envelope, I2C bus transaction additional semantics, including checksum. Unique features Base Protocol auto-addressing hot plugging. Auto-addressing assigns devices unique bus addresses, without need setting jumpers switches. Hot plugging ability attach detach devices system running, without rebooting. APPLICATION PROTOCOL: This highest level ACCESS.bus protocol defines message semantics specific particular types devices. Each type requires different Application Protocol. Three broad device types identified: keyboards, locators, text devices. ACCESS.bus support PC ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ All three levels ACCESS.bus protocol supported PC. An add-on card implements physical layer uses base protocol communicate physical ACCESS.bus devices. An ACCESS.bus Manager - TSR DOS DLL Windows 3.1 - controls operation physical layer interacts ACCESS.bus device drivers. Drivers available multiple ACCESS.bus keyboards, locators printers DOS Windows 3.1. Also available C language source code examples interface applications device drivers.

Technical information ======================== The player rather straightforward implementation MPEG spec [1]. The IDCT based Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2] (not quite optimum, I know). Blocks eight non-zero coefficients use non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT (sounds great, doesn't it?), turned faster 'fast' algorithm (quite common) case. Dithering pretty standard. Main difference Berkeley decoder (except fewer number supported algorithms) use 256 instead 128 colors, (default) option use restricted color-space implementation color saturation dominant ordered dither. This leads significantly superior quality dithered image (I claim, judge yourself). Restricted color-space means U V components clipped +/-0.25 (instead +/-0.5) display color-space points distributed restricted space. Since distance color-space points thus reduced factor two, color resolution doubled expense able represent fully saturated colors. Saturation dominant ordered dither method color, lying somewhere points display color space, approximated primarily alternating two points constant hue instead constant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due lower sensitivity human viewing system saturation changes hue changes (the reasoning used PAL TV standard improve NTSC). The improvement particularly visible dark brown redish areas. ...",0

They noted person's problem dos. The stealth card good dos performer. The Actix card rated best chip class (non local bus). It got glowing reports magazine (was best buy) I called directly updated windows drivers last week! They bulletin board get latest drivers. Though somone posted bbs 2400. AT rate, Actix graphics engine ultra outperforms cards 928 class (based winmark results). If looking around best dos/windows performance check actix card. Their 1-800 number 927-5557. P.S. The article pc magazine noted regular dos user (ie: games) also check 801 chip s3. It apparently scores well many cases slightly better dos 928 chip (ie: stealth actix cards.)

"As subjects says, Windows 3.1 keeps crashing (givinh GPF) late. It never stable package, seems crash every day. The worst part crash consistently: ie I can't reproduce crashes, always GPF's application. Sometimes I recover simply closing application caused error, times, windows acts strange, I need re-boot. Some background: I Leading Edge 486sx25 Phoenix BIOS. When I first got 4Mg memory. It ran windows fine (not many GPF's). Then, couple weekends ago, I installed Lotus 123 windows (with ATM), game card additional 4 1Mg SIMMS.

"Printer model specification: Canon CLC 500 (Color Laser Copier) ps-ipu unit (postscript intelligent processing unit) Hello, We recently purchased expensive nice color copier/printer.

I also print rgb files, turn converted postscript internal filter. The Canon CLC 500 publication quality printer quality postscript printouts less acceptable. We create postscript files variaty programs, showcase, xv, tops.
